0,"Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.",1) There is no need to worry about reinfection as the infection caused by Mumps virus does not persist in the body and is completely cleared up by the immune system.2) The swelling at your scrotum is due to inflammation of epididymis or vas deferens which is a result of mumps infection.3) There is no need to take antibiotics for this problem. You can take anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen for symptomatic relief.4) Doing cool compresses over the scrotal area will help in reducing the inflammation and pain.
1,"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","1) Cocaine use can affect fertility by causing male infertility due to decreased sperm motility and morphology as well as increased abnormal semen parameters (especially pH). However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that cocaine causes significant changes in female fertility.2) It is not clear how long cocaine remains in semen or blood after use. Therefore, it is difficult to say exactly when it will be completely gone from your husbands body.3) There is no data regarding the amount of time that couples need to abstain from sexual activity before attempting conception.4) In conclusion, if you want to become pregnant, then you should avoid coke for at least three months before trying to conceive. Hope this helps"
2,"Hello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?",1) The brown discharge is due to the hormonal imbalance in your body after missing the sugar pills. It will gradually settle down.2) There is no need to worry as there is nothing serious happening with you. Just wait for the brown discharge to subside.3) You can take a course of antibiotic like Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days if the problem persists.
3,"Hello doctor,My son aged 13 years has got his left eye -11 and right with -8. I am now very worried what good precautions should I take with him. Can you suggest me what should I do?"," Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern about your sons eyes. The best thing for you to do is to get an appointment with an ophthalmologist who can examine your sons eyes more thoroughly and determine if there are any treatable conditions that could be causing the vision loss in his eyes. There are some conditions that can cause vision loss at younger ages and it would not be wise to wait too long before getting him examined by a specialist. You may also want to have him checked out by a pediatrician or general practitioner as well to rule out other health related issues that could be contributing to his vision problems. Hope this helps. Good luck."

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore."," Hi, Thanks for your query. It appears that you are having post-operative complication like hematoma formation at the site of extraction socket. This can be due to trauma during surgical procedure or due to poor blood supply. You need to take an antibiotic like amoxicillin along with anti-inflammatory painkiller like ibuprofen. I suggest you to consult your dentist again and get evaluated. Hope this helps. Regards."
5,"Hello doctor,I had deep unprotected sex for three minutes with a broken condom with a sex worker who looks younger and healthy and aged between 18. It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected.

I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test."," Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As your sex partner is telling that she do not have any sexually transmitted disease then you don't have to worry much.

6,"Hello doctor,I need advice after my second CT chest result. Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?","1) The nodules are probably benign and unlikely to grow.2) There is no reason to worry about them at present.3) You may be monitored with CT scans every 6 months to see if they change in size or number.4) If they do change, then biopsy of these nodules can be done to determine whether they are cancerous or not.5) At present, you should just continue to follow up with CT scans every 6 months."

11,"I'm 40 & I've had glandular fever, shingles, influenza and have an autoimmune condition (Hashimoto's disease). I believe I may be more vulnerable than the average person my age to get Coronavirus, due to my weakened immune system? Should I be self isolating? I am ok to do so","1.

12,"Hello doctor,I am a 50-year-old female who has had an elevated ferritin level for many years now. My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.","1) Ferritin is a protein which stores iron in body and if its level increases it means there is increased demand of iron, hence more production of ferritin.2) Your iron levels are also fine so no need to worry about iron deficiency or any other problem related to iron.3) Fibromyalgia is a condition where pain can be felt anywhere in body. I think your doctors are rightly treating this condition by monitoring iron levels, but do not ignore your symptoms. 4) You should consult a psychiatrist who might prescribe medicines like pregabalin or duloxetine for fibromyalgia."
13,"Hello doctor,I have had a fishy odor down there since I was in elementary school. I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?","1. You need to get your lab tests done like-blood sugar levels, thyroid profile, prolactin levels, uterus & ovary ultrasound & smear test from gynecologist.2.

15,"Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.",1) Burning sensation on your chest could be due to acid reflux disease (GERD). This is a common condition where the gastric juices flows back into esophagus and causes discomfort. 2) Facial tightness can be due to muscle spasm. 3) Neither of these conditions are caused by anxiety. You should visit a physician who would examine you and then decide what tests he wants to order.

20,"Hello doctor,A few months before, I developed a gastric issue that required treatment with PPIs. Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over.

21,"Hello doctor,I would like to ask what is the likelihood that my partner who performs oral sex on me has trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis? He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food.

22,"Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. The blood levels of thyroid hormones are not always accurate in people with anxiety. In such cases, an ultrasound scan of the neck can be done which can help in differentiating between a normal thyroid gland and enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or goiter. In case of enlargement of the thyroid gland, the treatment is simple. It consists of taking anti-inflammatory medicines like steroids along with thyroxine. This is called as subclinical hyperthyroidism. In case of thyroiditis, the thyroid function tests may come back normal but there might be some changes seen on thyroid ultrasound. These are transient conditions and resolve over a period of time without any specific treatment. Do discuss the above with your doctor. Hope this helps."

Is that something cancerous?"," Hi, Dear, Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all its details.

29,"Hello doctor,I sustained an injury recently and I had an X-ray. The X-ray shows I have an intraarticular fracture of the right fifth metacarpal with significant ulnar displacement for consideration of ORIF. I went to my local hospital and they did a CT Scan. They sent me home and said to wait for their call to be seen at the Fracture Clinic. I have only buddy taping on my little and next finger. People are telling me it should be strapped or cast right away. I am worried."," Hi there! Thanks for writing your query here. I would like to tell you that in case of any bony injury, it is always better to get yourself examined by a physician and not just rely on what people say. Also, as per my experience, if you do not require a surgery then a simple splint will suffice. In case if you need a surgical intervention then a plaster cast is required. So, you can wait till you get examined by the orthopedic surgeon. Hope this information was useful to you. Wishing you good health."
30,"Hello doctor,My fiancee had a bleeding on the 25th of last month. It lasted for about four to five days. She then got dengue and on the 14th of this month, had mild spotting for a day and a half. The doctor said it could be the dengue causing the spotting. She has not gotten her periods yet. I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bleeding can occur in pregnancy due to many reasons like miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies etc. and should be investigated thoroughly. Dengue also causes bleeding from time to time. But if she is still bleeding after 3 weeks or so, she needs to get investigated further. The period might become irregular during pregnancy. The bleeding might be due to some other cause than dengue. So, better to see a gynecologist and take opinion regarding the same."

I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help."," Hi, Thanks for writing to us. I appreciate your concern regarding your eye sight.

In case of any doubt, I will be available for follow-up queries. Wishing you good health."

I do not have pain in the tooth and half of the tooth is poking out now. But I have trouble in opening my mouth fully.","1) Yes, the tooth will erupt as long as there is enough space for it to come through.2) Pain or discomfort while opening your mouth is usually due to inflammation caused by the tooth coming through the gums.3) The tooth has already erupted half way and should complete its growth soon.4) Do not worry about the tooth as there is no need to remove it unless it causes severe pain or interferes with eating or speaking.

It lasted for four days and the flow was normal. After 14 days of this incident, I again had protected sexual intercourse and took another I-pill after 36 hours. But this time even after 11 days, there is no withdrawal bleeding. Is this because of hormonal imbalance or pregnancy?","1) You have taken i-pill twice with a gap of 7 weeks. This is not recommended by WHO.2) Withdrawal bleeding occurs within 8 to 10 days of taking I-Pill. If it has been more than that, then it may be due to hormonal imbalance (increased progesterone levels).3) In such case, you need to consult your gynecologist for proper evaluation and treatment."

36,"Hello doctor,My father recently had a heart attack and a stroke. Then had two heart valves repaired and they want to put a stent in. His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. As you have mentioned your fathers history with heart attack and stroke, it seems that he has got coronary artery disease which means blockages in coronary vessels supplying blood to heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain (angina) while exercise or stress. Since your father has been given metoprolol and warfarin, it suggests that he is at risk of clot formation either due to heart attack or atherosclerosis. The other medicines like potassium, losartan, statins etc. are used to control high blood pressure as well as diabetes. These medicines also reduce the chance of further blockage in coronary vessels and hence prevention of future heart attacks. Hence, it is necessary to continue all these medicines. You may discuss with your father's treating doctor regarding splitting the doses of some of the medicines if required."

If the pain is subsided then no need to worry about the infection as it will take some time to clear up the area. 2. Continue using Otinex ear drops until you feel better.3. If you are not getting relief within one week of use then consult your doctor & get examined.4. It can be due to bacterial or viral infections.5. To confirm the diagnosis you may require taking a swab test from the ear canal to rule out any kind of infection like bacteria, virus etc. Hope this helps you. Thanks"
38,"Hello doctor,So, I have hives, also known as chronic urticaria. Basically, I break out when the climate I am in is hot, or when I exercise. I visited my family doctor and he told me to get a blood test and he also gave me a Cetirizine (Zyrtec) prescription which is 20 mg. I have been taking this medication for about four days now, and I still get these itchy hives. If I were to get a blood test, will the doctor be able to prescribe the right medication, so I can get rid of these annoying hives?","1st thing to do is to confirm if you have allergies or not. You should avoid exposure to the substances that cause allergy. If they are airborne, then try to keep away from them. For food-based allergies, you need to identify what type of food causes problem. That can be done by doing patch tests. For skin related allergies, patch testing can help to identify the substance causing problems.

I have taken unwanted 72 on the third day morning after having breakfast. But, still, my periods have not yet started. Can you please help me out with the reason behind that?","1. Hi, I understand your concern. The chances of conception are high if you had intercourse around ovulation time (14th-20th day).

The doctor prescribed him Benadryl 5 ml and Crocin DS 7.5 ml. He has not given any antibiotics. Is it fine? Please suggest.","1) nasal blockage2) fever3) swollen throat & tonsils4) no antibiotic - this indicates that its viral infection with secondary bacterial infection. Since your child is having nasal blockade, I would advise you to give him steam inhalation and apply vapor rub on his chest and palms. This will help him to get rid of cold symptoms faster.

47,"Hi doctor,My lab tests are as follows:Seven months ago: blood glucose of 105 mg/dl, GTT one hour 160 mg/dl, two hours 118 mg/dl, morning insulin 6.2 \xce\xbcU/ml, HbA1c 5.2 %, A1 6.1 %.

I am male 32 years old 1.86 cm 93 kg 13 to 14 % body fat athletic with healthy nutrition habits. No history of diabetes in the family.

I was told by my doctor that I had to keep monitoring my blood glucose since I could develop diabetes later on, and since I have never had a problem with blood sugar as a kid and no family history of diabetes, I was wondering what might be going on cause insulin levels dropped from my last test and since my diet was pretty much same with healthy choices why is this happening. My doctor for the last seven months kept telling me to calm down and that I do not have anything cause stressing is bad for my blood glucose too. Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?","1. You need to know that there is only one type of Cancer which is Pancreatic carcinoma that can cause high Insulin levels. 2. The reason your doctor is asking you not to worry about this and also not to go for any investigations is because he knows that if he does an investigation then if it comes out positive there will be a lot of stress and anxiety and this itself will affect your blood sugars and diabetic control. 3. Now, the fact that you have been told to monitor blood sugar and there has been a drop in your fasting Blood Sugar levels (and insulin levels) means that you should definitely go for some investigations like CBC, Urine routine, Ultrasound abdomen. 4. Please meet your treating Doctor and discuss all these points, otherwise you may end up with more problems than now."
48,"Hi doctor,I have noticed that my first molar is loose. I keep pushing it with my tongue and clenching a bit against it and I just noticed that it has become loose little more.

51,"Hello doctor, I have been going to a dentist about a tooth that is sore. They started a root canal but then did not finish. I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?","1) The treatment of choice for an infected tooth is a root canal therapy. During the course of the root canal treatment, the dentist will be able to determine whether the nerve is viable or not. If the nerve has died (necrosis), he/she will remove the dead tissue and leave the healthy tissue alone.2) If the nerve is viable, the dentist will clean out the canals and fill them with a sealer. Root canal therapy is a very successful treatment option and once done, there should be no further discomfort.3) After the root canal treatment is complete, the tooth should be restored with a crown. Please do not hesitate to contact us again if you require any additional information."

I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me."," Hi there, thanks for writing in. The eye pain is likely due to irritants like dust or pollen. It can also be due to inflammation of the conjunctiva which is called conjunctivitis. You need to get your eyes examined by an Ophthalmologist who will examine your eyes thoroughly.

And what should I take for this problem, what should I eat? (Can you assure there is no cancer)?","1) Pain in your sternum may be due to inflammation of the esophagus or stomach caused by the bleeding. You need to get evaluated by your physician/surgeon for possible causes. 2) No, it does not mean that you do not have cancer.

55,"Hello doctor,Is there a difference in alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwash. Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic? I am in a hygiene school and want to know whether or not to recommend non-alcohol mouthwash for the complaints of bad breath from smoking. I have recommended tongue scraping, alcoholic mouthwash. Anyways, they are not going to stop smoking or drinking. I was looking at a way to have them not dry out the tissues, but stopping the obvious factors do not seem to be an option."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. Mouthwash containing chlorhexidine (0.12%) is very effective in controlling halitosis caused by smoking. It has antibacterial properties that help in control of bacteria causing bad breath. It also helps in keeping your gums healthy and prevents plaque formation. Alcohol free mouthwashes can cause irritation to the mucosa lining the mouth and may even worsen bad breath. So, it is advisable to use chlorhexidine mouthwash if you smoke. You may need to rinse with this mouthwash for about 3 months to see visible results."

59,"Hello doctor,I wanted to know if you could answer one question for me. I experienced an episode that lasted roughly about two to three minutes where I felt that I could not seem to catch my breath and it felt as if my heart had stopped beating. I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions."," Hi there, thanks for writing in. The symptoms you have mentioned are suggestive of a panic attack. It may occur during sexual arousal or orgasm due to increased blood flow to the brain. During erection, the penis is filled with blood and causes pressure changes in the bladder leading to urinary retention. Sometimes, this can cause sudden pressure on the abdomen leading to chest pain and breathing difficulty. So, in short, these symptoms may be related to any of the above reasons. But, since you have been diagnosed with ectopic beats, I would strongly recommend going for further investigations. ECG, stress test, echo etc. should be done to rule out cardiac problems. A psychiatrist consultation would help treat any associated anxiety issues. Hope this helps."

65,"Hello doctor,I am feeling really down. I have had a lot of digestive problems for about two years. I have been diagnosed with candida and dysbiosis but my regular doctor does not seem to know what is wrong with me. I have been very stressed and have suffered anxiety since I was about 16. I was not on any medications and started taking Cymbalta a few months ago.After about three to four days, I started to notice a bit of burning in my feet. I have since stopped taking the Cymbalta about a month ago. My feet seemed fine. Then seven days ago, I have started getting really bad pain in my feet and burning and tickling and pins and needle feelings. I am not diabetic or alcoholic. I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help."," Hi, dear thanks for the query. Your symptoms are suggestive of neuropathy. You should consult physician to rule out the cause for such symptoms.

70,"Hello doctor,Around a year ago, some red pimples started appearing around my mouth, chin, forehead, and my nose. These small red pimples create a red area when seen from far away because they are very small and inflamed. It never disappears. My skin always feels stuck and not flexible and with a mildly itchy or burning sensation. No matter how much moisturizer I apply, it does not help.

I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit!

I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer\s. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free."," Hi there, your concern is valid as you have been experiencing this for quite some time now. Although, the exact cause can only be known after a thorough clinical evaluation and investigation, however, from what you have mentioned here, it does seem like you are having problems with concentration and focus in life. This could be due to many reasons which would need further assessment and evaluation. You may also have to undergo some investigations like blood tests, CT scan etc. to rule out any other causes. However, I would suggest you to meet up with a psychiatrist who will help you diagnose the problem and provide you with the right treatment options. Wish you all the best."
99,"Hi doctor,Five years ago my mother was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis. For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening. When she lies down in the bed she gets electrical tingling in her legs by which her sleep gets disturbed. She has undergone several tests last week and I attached them for your reference. She did not consult a rheumatologist yet. What medication can I give to reduce the inflammation and cure her? Her ESR, CPR, and ANA are quite high. The pain in her hands and the tingling in her legs at night are agonizing her life. Kindly provide your expert advice."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition. It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as fatigue and tenderness of specific points on palpation (trigger points). The trigger points may be tender even after the muscle has been completely relaxed. The pain may be severe enough to limit daily activities or require bed rest. Treatment includes lifestyle changes such as exercise, stress management, proper sleep hygiene, physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and medications such as Tricyclic antidepressants, muscle relaxants, analgesics, Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Sleeping pills etc. I would advise you to take treatment from an Rheumatologist who will help you with the above mentioned options.

100,"Hello doctor,I am currently having acne on my cheeks. I am currently applying Benzoyl peroxide gel on my acne. It only reduces the inflammation but bumps are not reducing. I also have pigmentation caused by acne before. I only get acne on my cheeks. What may be the reason? I usually get cyst acne bumps on my cheeks. If acne clears, then it comes again. I have red pigmentation caused by acne. Can you recommend a product for acne and after acne has cleared, can you suggest a product for pigmentation? Can you recommend a product for controlling further breakouts? Also, I wanted to know which sunscreen and moisturizer to use?","1) Benzyl peroxide is an antiseptic agent which acts against the infection causing microorganisms. It is not a treatment for acne or pigmentation as such.2) Acne lesions can recur if adequate measures are not taken. The best way to prevent them is to maintain good hygiene by washing face twice daily with a mild soap/cleanser and keep your skin clean. Avoid excessive oiliness of face. Use benzoyl peroxide gels for local application over active areas.3) After acne subsides, apply a cream containing clindamycin, tretinoin and azelaic acid. Apply this cream at nighttime only.4) For pigmentation, use a cream containing retinoid (Retinol), niacinamide and kojic acid.5) Sunscreen should contain SPF 3"

Second time, I started having this brownish or yellowish discharge and I have taken the photo of the discharge. I am not sure what it is? Neither of us have STDs. I am quite scared of being pregnant. I do not remember when I had my last period. Is this discharge normal? Please help me.","1st you need to know your ovulation day, as you did intercourse during that phase only. So, chances of getting pregnancy is less. As per your history, you had unprotected sex few times, so possibility of getting pregnancy is high. You can go for urine pregnancy test after one week of missed periods. Brownish or yellowish discharge could be due to vaginal infection like bacterial Vaginosis (BV).

117,"Hello doctor,Just two days ago I found out I was about 1-2 weeks pregnant. And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated."," Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine which is a group C teratogen, meaning it can cause harm to the fetus. It should not be taken during pregnancy if possible. However, there are some women who may need it for their health, and they will have to weigh risks vs benefits. If you were taking Lorazepam only, you might consider taking it while pregnant. You could try switching to another anti-anxiety medicine such as clonazepam or alprazolam. These two are considered safe during early pregnancy. In addition, you should continue to take your other medication such as percocet. This can help reduce the symptoms of nausea, headache etc. Hope this helps. Take care."

Is it possible to get fat on just one side of the body like that?","1) Yes, it is possible to get fat on just one side of the body like that.2) The best way to determine this is through an ultrasound examination of your abdomen/breast area.3) The lump could be a lipoma or a cyst.4) In either case, surgical excision would be required for definitive management.5) I suggest you visit a general surgeon who will examine you thoroughly and help you with further investigation and treatment.

135,"Hello doctor,My daughter is 2 years old. Now, she is speaking only 3 to 4 words. She is not talking like other children. Please tell me if she has any kind of disorder. I have been to the doctor once and he told nothing to worry. After 2 years only they can speak. But my elder daughter spoke when she was 1.5 years old. I am so worried about her. Please tell me what to do. Her birth weight is 3.2 and now she is around 9 I think.","1st thing is, you should not compare your child with others. Every kid develop at different rate, and some may be ahead of others in some aspects while some may be behind. So don't worry about it. If she is not speaking as much as other kids who are same age then that could be due to her language development or some learning disability. I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician and get her evaluated for autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, learning disabilities etc."
136,"Hello doctor,My 13 year old daughter has been suffering from vomitings and loose motions since two days. She had a fever of about 101.3 the day before yesterday. Our doctor advised her to take Oflox OZ and Sporolac DS. She has had five doses of Oflox OZ till now.The fever has gone and the number of motions has also reduced, though still watery but she is not eating anything. Her appetite is lost and even if she eats a little she complains of nausea though she is not throwing up. I am giving her Emeset for nausea. Is this a normal stomach infection?"," Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for calling Chat Doctor. Forum.  Your daughter may be having gastroenteritis or some viral infection. The symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea are commonly seen with such type of infections. The vomiting may be due to the disease itself or due to the medicines which were prescribed. The loss of appetite could be due to either of the above causes. For your information, the antibiotics used for treatment of gastrointestinal infections have no effect on any other infections except those occurring in the gut. So it would be better to consult a pediatrician and get treated accordingly. Wishing good health to your daughter."
137,"Hi doctor,My front tooth got chipped away before two days. I am so nervous about it. How to recover my tooth?"," Hello, It is possible to repair the chipped tooth by using composite restoration or porcelain veneer. However, if the damage is severe enough that the nerve inside the tooth becomes exposed, then root canal treatment may be necessary. For this reason, I recommend you to visit your dentist and get an x-ray done of the tooth. After examination he can suggest you the best option. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
138,"Hi doctor,My son hit his mouth on the bathtub while playing when he was 9 months old, causing both top front teeth to be pushed up into his gums. They came back down, and the dentist said they were fine. Now he is 4.5 years old, one of the teeth is ready to fall, and his dentist wants to pull out the other front tooth with a strong root. He says it is best if they both come out at the same time, but did not explain further. Is pulling an absolutely good tooth the best option? I am attaching the x-rays of the teeth."," Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case of trauma the tooth has to be removed as it is nonvital and there is no chance of saving it. The tooth which has already erupted can be saved by RCT (root canal treatment) or extraction depending upon the status of the tooth. In case of traumatic injury the tooth has to be extracted as there is risk of infection spreading to adjacent teeth. For any more queries you may contact me. Wishing him good health and early recovery."
139,"Hello doctor,I suffered from terrible anxiety and OCD that seems to come and go over time. My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems.I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother's exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?"," Hi, Your TSH is normal (3.2) and so is your Free Thyroxin Index (FT4). The only thing which needs attention is your Free Triiodothyronine (FT3). It is raised. So, it is essential for me to know whether you have any symptoms of hyperthyroidism or not. As you are using sertraline, it may take some time to show its effect. So, I suggest you continue taking sertraline for at least another month before changing anything. You need to get a repeat FT3 done after about a week. If it is still high, then you will need to get a scan done to see whether there is any problem in the gland itself. And then change the treatment accordingly. Hope this helps."

141,"Hello doctor,I experienced a rash after an allergic reaction that spans from my chest, neck, and face. I removed the allergen from my diet and was prescribed Elidel to help clear the rash. However, I experienced over the course of two to three days, white patches which look as there is absolutely no pigment present in these areas. Will hypopigmentation from the use of Elidel fade? I was prescribed Elidel for the first time for a rash on my face. I am pale, but these are extremely white patches reminiscent of acne scars (but being completely flat). Is this likely to be permanent? Will it likely fade? If it may fade, how long would this likely take? What are my potential treatment options? No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated."," Hi, Thank you for posting your query. You should not worry about the whitish patches as they are unlikely to be due to Elidel medications. The most common cause of such patches is vitiligo. These patches can be treated with steroid creams or phototherapy. Please consult a dermatologist for further management. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information.

146,"Hello doctor,My first baby is healthy and my blood group is A positive and my wife\s blood group is B negative. Now, my wife is again pregnant and has completed 26 weeks of pregnancy. She has developed antibodies and the latest ICT with titer test results show 1:64. Last week, we also did sonography and that did not have any impact on the baby.Now, the doctor suggests giving some steroids in this week which will help to develop the baby\s lungs faster to prevent any complication.

147,"Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male, who is a competitive athlete. I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?"," Hi, Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and here is my advice.- As you already know that you are having Woolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syn Chat Doctor.  - And you don't have any symptoms related to arrhythmias.- So, no need to take any medication like flecainide, unless you have symptoms related to arrhythmias.- Just wait for the ablation procedure which will be done after 2 weeks.- This is my best advice for you based on available details.

It is present at the bottom of one of my lower molars. It hurts me a lot. How long will it take to spread throughout the body?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you describe, you had painful abscess in your lower jaw for more than a year. This may be due to decayed tooth or gum infection. As there is recurrence of infection in the same area, it means that tooth has not been treated properly. You should consult dentist and get examination done. X-ray of the involved region should be taken. Treatment depends upon the diagnosis. If it is due to gum infection then scaling and root planning with antibiotics will help. If it is because of decayed tooth then extraction followed by filling can help. Hope this helps. Take care."

153,"Hi doctor,My daughter had braces for four years but her midline is off and she has a gummy smile. Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. This is an excellent question from your part. I can understand your concerns about the facial changes due to surgery. I would like to tell you that facial surgery is done to improve function or appearance of the face. Facial structures remain unchanged except some minor changes as mentioned above. So, there should be no major change in the face after facial surgery. However, if any change in the facial structure is noticed during the post-operative period, it can be reversed only by reoperation. So, my suggestion to you would be to get a thorough examination done by the maxillofacial surgeon before proceeding further. Hope this helps."
154,"Hello doctor,I am a 21 year old female. Yesterday, doctors have checked my blood. I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?","1. Iron deficiency anemia may take long time to treat. It requires continuous follow up and treatment with iron supplementation. You need to continue your iron supplements for few more months before the results can be seen.2. Your hemoglobin level is gradually increasing. It will help you improve your energy level.3. Viral infection may cause your immunity to decrease and therefore increase the number of white cells in the body. This includes neutrophil and lymphocytes. So once the viral infection is treated the numbers should come down.4. Thrombocytosis may occur with the presence of any inflammation in the body. Inflammation may be due to virus, bacteria or parasites. So if you are having infection anywhere in the body it is possible that this could be the reason for your thrombocytosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know"

It should not cause any side effects if taken in proper dosage. The other medicines you mentioned are also used for treating hypothyroidism. You can try them.

You may get some blood tests done like thyroid profile, vitamin D levels etc. If there is no underlying cause then you can take medicines which help stop the hair fall like finasteride. You may also use minoxidil lotion. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health. Take care"
167,"Hi doctor,My scar revision surgery is not healing well, and it seems worse than last week. Please see the attached picture. Involuntary frowning causes lines to run through the scar, can this be causing problems? Is it worth taping my forehead, so I cannot make frown lines? Is it worth getting a botox to stop frowning till I am healed? I am using a vitamin C and silicone scar cream to attempt better removal of hyperpigmentation. Is this a problem? I cannot tell if it is this or the creasing making it worse. I am starting to get very depressed about this scar revision. It was bad enough getting mugged and getting this wound. Now it is not healing even after a scar revision surgery. Thanks.","1) The scar is still redder than at first surgery. 2) It looks like a hypertrophied scar with thickness (not just color) 3) Vitamin C and silicon may help but it will take some time for them to work. 4) The creases in your face may cause more stress on the scar, so it may be best to wait until the scar has settled down before trying to do anything else.5) Botox would likely reduce facial movement which could lead to less creasing of the scar.6) You could try tape to prevent wrinkles from forming while healing.7) Taping alone won't fix a hypertrophied scar, but it should help reduce the amount of redness.8) I hope that helps."
168,"Hello doctor,I had my tooth checked up last year, and the doctor told me to go for an OPG as he was planning for a root canal therapy. But due to severe negligence and work, I could not do that. It is almost a year now, and tonight I am having a painful time. Please tell me whether there is a chance of spread of infection. Please help. My infected tooth is the right first molar of the lower jaw.",1. As per your history it seems that there is an infection in your tooth which has been left untreated for a long period of time.2. The bacteria present in the tooth can cause pus formation in the area around the tooth leading to swelling and pain.3. The pain might be because of the pressure from the inflamed gum over the tooth.4. You should consult an oral surgeon who will examine the tooth and decide whether RCT can be done or extraction is needed.5. In case if RCT cannot be done then extraction is the only option.6. You need to take antibiotics and analgesic medication till you visit the dentist.7. Hope this helps
169,"Hi doctor,My back tooth has developed a deep cavity within a few months. Now I have a pain in that tooth which got worse this morning. My cheek and throat have a sore, and they are swollen. It became a deep cavity when my filling fell out.","1. The decay had spread deeply into your tooth causing it to weaken and fracture.2. Whenever there is a deep decay or fractured tooth that can not be restored with a filling, it needs to be treated by root canal treatment (RCT) and crown restoration.3. This will help prevent further damage to the tooth and also relieve the pain and sensitivity of the tooth.4. Please visit an Endodontist immediately for RCT and crown preparation.5. Take antibiotics such as Amoxicillin 500 mg TID for 5 days along with anti-inflammatory medicines like Acetaminophen for pain relief. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
170,"Hi doctor,I am 18 years old. A few days ago, I had a toothache on my molar teeth and have mobility when touched. I have a big hole in that tooth from my childhood. I guess the black circle is the vein of the tooth. I could not afford to get an implant tooth. I had pain in that tooth a year back and then now. Is it possible to cure with rebuilding this tooth instead of removing it? Here is the picture for your reference."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Your question is related to dental problem. As per your complaint if there is no pulp exposure and root canal treatment was done earlier than you can go for crown placement over the tooth, and it will be a good option.

171,"Hi doctor,I have PCOD, and I am planning to conceive. I am under Macfolate and Metformin tablets for the past seven months. I have regular periods for the past six months. This month, on the 11th day, I missed my period. After two days, when I checked for pregnancy, I got a negative result. Again after seven days, I got a negative result after checking for pregnancy. I am getting mucus discharge in small amounts. It does not have any foul odor. Am I pregnant? Why is it showing negative?"," Thanks for your question. You are already taking both folic acid and metformin. These medications are taken by women who are trying to get pregnant. The reason why these pills are prescribed is that they help in improving ovulation and thus increasing chances of conception. So in my opinion, you have been taking the right course of treatment. You should continue with the same medicines for at least 3-6 months before considering other options like IVF or surgery. Also, if you want to try naturally then do not worry as there is no harm in doing so. You can take natural remedies such as yoga, meditation, healthy diet etc. You can also take herbal supplements like Ashwagandha capsules which helps increase fertility.

I can see fully clear when it is about 5 to 10 cm from my eye (letters) but it became blurry when the distance increases. Right eye is pretty fine but left eyes are not proper as right.

You may have developed an ocular problem called Presbyopia which is a natural aging process of our eyes and is seen mostly in people above 40 years of age.

Kindly suggest me whether the root canal is needed for this or I can save my tooth using some other methods?","1) Yes, it is possible for the nerve to heal by itself.2) But if there is no pus formation then you should wait and watch.3) Root canal treatment will help in preventing further infection in the tooth.4) If the tooth becomes mobile than you should do root canal treatment5) In your case, I would advise you to wait and watch until the symptoms subside completely."
178,"Hello doctor,I am a 31-year-old male with a history of closed globe injury in the right eye 10 years ago. At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use.

179,"Hi doctor,I have a lower wisdom tooth that has been infected chronically for well over a year. I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action? Are there other antibiotics for this? Am I dying from the infection already? Any of your advice or help is appreciated. My other possibly relevant health history is as follows: I have high blood pressure, tachycardia, high cholesterol and mild PVC\s. I had a MRSA infection in my arm 10 years ago. I have many strep throat infections every year and frequent sinus issues. Also, I would like to mention that when I took smoothed Cephalexin capsule with a sip of water, I got a random salty taste in my mouth.", Thanks for asking Chat Doctor.  You need to consult your Oral Surgeon immediately. Do not wait. It is better to get the tooth extracted now itself rather than waiting for it to get infected more. You should take the antibiotic as per your doctors advise. There is nothing wrong with Clindamycin. Take it under close supervision of your treating physician. But make sure that you don't develop any rashes during the treatment. Hope this helps
180,"Hello doctor,I have pain in my upper wisdom teeth for the past one year. I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain. Please advise me what I can do. If I do not remove my teeth, then what will be its side effect?","1) As per your history, you are having pain in your upper wisdom teeth since last one year. You need to get an x-ray done to see if there is any food lodgment or anything else which might be causing this pain. Once this problem is solved you should not worry about the removal of wisdom teeth as it has nothing to do with optic nerve or brain. 2) If you don't want to go ahead with the removal of wisdom teeth at present time, you can take a medication like ibuprofen for pain relief."

However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come. Meantime, I just want to understand why this happened to her and will this happen regularly and what is the treatment needed to prevent this from happening again.

This means that there is some problem with the muscles around the eye which is leading to difficulty in keeping the eye in its normal position. Proptosis is usually seen in many conditions like Graves disease, Thyrotoxicosis, inflammation of the lids etc. I would advise you to get your mother evaluated by an ophthalmologist who will examine her eyes and make sure if there is any problem with the muscle movements. Also, you need to get a complete blood count done along with thyroid function test to rule out the above-mentioned causes."

185,"Hi doctor, My 2-year-old son is having a lot of trouble sleeping. He snores every night and tosses and turns and has trouble breathing through his nose. His doctor says he has enlarged tonsils and adenoids. I think he has obstructed sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.We did a sleep study and the night of the sleep study he slept well. But every night at home he has a lot of trouble sleeping. He wakes up a lot, talks in his sleep has nightmares and I think he has sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes.The doctor said we could try Flonaise to help him. But we read that Flonaise can stunt a child's growth. The doctor said he could grow into his tonsils. And I also heard that 2 years old is very young for tonsil surgery.My questions are how worried should I be about his troubled seeping? I am not getting any sleep lately because I listen to him all night. Is it dangerous to let him go on trying to sleep and have so much trouble breathing each night with possible sleep apnea? Please help. I am very concerned.","1) sleep apnea is a common condition in kids with large tonsils & adenoids. The symptoms of sleep apnea include restlessness during sleep, loud snoring, frequent awakening from sleep, difficulty in breathing etc. You need to consult an ENT surgeon who may advise you to remove the tonsils or adenoids by way of surgical removal. 2) there is no harm in removing the tonsils if they cause obstruction to the airway while sleeping. As far as sleep apnea is concerned, it needs to be treated immediately to avoid long term complications like poor academic performance, behavioral problems, daytime sleepiness etc.3) the most appropriate treatment for sleep apnea is surgery to remove the tonsils/adenoids.

Premature ejaculation may be due to anxiety only. 2) Premature ejaculation is not associated with infertility.3) Premature ejaculation can occur in new relationship also.

Should I continue Meftal syrup irrespective of fever level along with Calpol and antibiotic as to control the fever levels? I am worried why the fever keeps coming back the same level even though now four doses of antibiotic are completed."," Hi dear, thanks for your question. The symptoms you have mentioned may be due to viral illness. Fever can come down when antibiotics are given, because they help in reducing inflammation. But if fever comes up again then it means that the cause of fever is still present. So, you need to visit a pediatrician and get a physical examination done. It will give an idea about the exact problem. Also, do a throat swab test for streptococcus and get treated accordingly."

Is this normal to have this much discharge so close to my past period?",11 hours after your periods should not be possible as the hormone level will come down by then and hence menstrual bleeding will also stop. You need to check with your gynecologist regarding the same. If you are sexually active then you could get pregnant again. As far as vaginal discharge is concerned it can happen at any time during the cycle.

Is there anything I can do to increase their height? I want my daughter to be 5.6 tall and son to be 6 ft tall. Will giving protein powder make any difference? Kindly do the needful."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern regarding the height of your child. It is not unusual for a child to grow at different rates during infancy and early childhood, but it is important that parents become aware of the normal rate at which a child should grow. The average boy reaches his adult height by age 21 years. The average girl reaches her adult height by age 19 years. In general, boys reach their full growth potential sooner than girls. This means that boys usually attain their maximum height between ages 11-14 years while girls reach their maximum height between ages 9-13 years. At birth, the baby is approximately 25 cm in length (a little more than a foot) and weighs about 3.5 kg (7.7 pounds). By age 2, the baby has doubled its birth length and tripled its birth weight.

192,"Hello doctor,Seven years ago, I ruptured my right eardrum. I recently went to my doctor because I lost some of my hearing, and I have been having pains in my right ear. My doctor told me that the ear drum healed but there is a lot of scarring on it. Why is my eardrum hurting if it is improved?",1) The pain may be due to the scar tissue causing irritation to the nerves supplying the ear.2) You need to get an audiometry test done to see how much hearing has been affected.3) If there is no significant loss of hearing then the pain can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.4) If there is significant loss of hearing then surgery may be required to repair the eardrum.5) You need to consult your ENT specialist for proper evaluation and treatment.
193,"Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure, internal hemorrhoid, SRUS, and constipation. One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.","1. I would really suggest that you visit a surgeon and get your anal fissures treated. This can only be done by surgery. 2.

194,"Hello doctor,The stomach blossoms without food, even in the morning. It is felt more in the upper part of the stomach.", Hi there! I am sorry to hear about your symptoms. I can understand that this could be very uncomfortable and worrying for you. The most common cause of bloating is due to excessive gas formation in the intestine. This happens when we eat certain foods which are not digested properly or if we have an overgrowth of bacteria in our gut. Another possible cause would be due to any condition of the gallbladder like stones or inflammation. You should get yourself examined by a gastroenterologist who will examine you and do some tests to see what exactly is causing it.

I asked for Profol but got no answer. I spoke to a male nurse, not an anesthesiologist. If the Fenytal overrides the sub will I be in withdraw? Also, are there safety issues combining these medicines? Should I cancel this procedure?"," The use of fentanyl is common during cardiac catheterization. It has been found that it does not affect the efficacy of the catheterization or the outcome. The use of Suboxone should not interfere with the use of fentanyl. Combining these medications may increase your risk for respiratory depression. However, you should discuss this with your physician as he/she will be able to assess if the benefits outweigh the risks. You can still have the procedure, however, you should be aware of the potential side effects of the medication."

I am really worried if I should take the pill again. This was a terrible mistake.

If the pill was taken prior to the release of your egg/ovulation then it will prevent pregnancy.3) But if you were already past the point of ovulating then there is no reason for you to worry as long as you do not become pregnant within the next 72 hours.4) The other thing to be concerned about is having any side effects from the pill like nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness etc. These symptoms usually start about 5-6 days after taking the pill.5) There is no reason to repeat the same mistake again.

As you describe your symptoms, I would like to explain that it could be due to allergy or sinusitis. You should visit a GP doctor to rule out any other causes of headache. In case of allergy, you may need antihistamines and decongestants. In case of sinusitis, antibiotics will be needed if there is infection. You should take plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Hope this answers your query. Take care."
198,"Hello doctor,I would like to know if my hypothyroidism can be cured without taking the synthetic hormones, through Ayurveda only. In the allopathic approach, the hormone needs to be taken for the rest of one\s life and I am a bit scared of it. It is possible I may also be diabetic and will need to treat this as well. Can these conditions be successfully dealt with through ayurvedic treatments alone?"," Hi, No, there is no permanent cure for hypothyroidism in ayurveda. Ayurveda has many medicines which can control thyroid problems but not permanently. You have to take levothyroxine throughout your life. But you can try some herbal supplements and lifestyle changes which can help in reducing symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor."
199,"Hello doctor,I have an important query about the contraceptive pill. On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:Should she take the morning after pill?How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy?How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy?Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)?Do you recommend taking today's pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today?Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk?Should we be worried?Thank you.","1. No need to worry, she should not take emergency contraception. Emergency contraception is meant to prevent conception when it occurs around fertile days. But since she was already on birth control pills which are effective in preventing pregnancy, and even though she missed one day, it still provides protection against pregnancy. 2. Missing one day of pill does not reduce its efficacy. 3. Yes, she should avoid sexual intercourse until she starts her next pack of pills. 4. Pill reduces the probability of pregnancy by more than 90%. 5. She may get delayed menstruation with pill. 6. Morning after pill should not be used as regular means of contraception."
200,"Hello doctor,I am taking Paxidep 12.5 daily from last one and half year as prescribed by the doctor. It cures my uncontrolled thought and panic attacks. Now sometime I feel shocks in my head. I also want to know that, is there any side effect of this medicine after long time use?","1/31Paxidep is a benzodiazepine which has sedative and anxiolytic effects. It can be used for short term relief of anxiety symptoms. It should not be taken for more than six months without consulting your psychiatrist because it may cause dependence or addiction. Dependence means physical tolerance develops, so that same dose doesn't work anymore. Also, if stopped suddenly, withdrawal symptoms like dizziness, tremors etc. occur. So I advise you to visit your psychiatrist soon and get evaluated."

208,"Hello doctor,I am 18 years old. I did an 8-week cycle that ended 14 days ago. The cycle consisted of applying a topical DHT gel, exactly 100 mg of pure DHT per week (15 mg per day) for eight weeks. I did it because I read that DHT could improve my puberty and increase the size of the penis. Now I am still small and feel that my hormone levels are lower. The question is could it be harmful to make another cycle or should I stop? Now, that I have stopped should I do a PCT? My wish would be to increase the penis dimensions without damaging my HPTA axis.","1. Your concern is very valid, as there are plenty of adverse effects associated with anabolic steroid use.2. It has been suggested that steroids can cause premature closure of epiphyses, which may lead to short stature in adult life.3. Other long term side effects include gonadal atrophy and testicular failure, which may result in infertility.4. Anabolic steroids also affect liver enzyme levels, which can lead to hepatotoxicity.5.

So if you want to go ahead with this, I suggest you to consult a qualified physician who will advise you accordingly. Hope this helps. Regards"
209,"Hello doctor,I am a 20-year-old female. About a week ago, I noticed an ingrown hair in my pubic area. I left it for a couple of days and then put a hot compression on the area, exfoliated, and tried to free the hair. I used a pin to pull the end out of the skin so I could tweeze the hair out, but I ended up popping the pump and pus just started oozing out. It was sore the next morning and I let it go until tonight, I tried to free the hair again and just ended up squeezing the lump, this time it was a bit larger, again blood and pus came out, but I pulled a hair out with the tweezers and I believe that it was the ingrown hair. I just noticed that my right lymph node in my neck and my groin area are swollen. I would rather not go to see my doctor. Any advice? And the tweezers and pin were both sterilized both times."," Hi, Thanks for writing to us. The symptoms you have described are suggestive of infected ingrown hair.

Allergy symptoms like nasal congestions are common with rhinitis (allergic sinusitis). This could be due to any allergen such as pollen, mold, dust, food or pet dander. In order to reduce these symptoms, you should avoid exposure to allergens, use antihistamines such as levocetrizine or fexofenadine, and use nasal corticosteroids (fluticasone) if required. Vascular problems may also lead to similar symptoms. These include low blood pressure and low blood sugar.

It is also a non-invasive test and does not require any radiation exposure. A normal CT scan means that there are no signs of metastatic disease.

My teeth are brittle because if I eat something hard they sometimes break or I would feel a hole developing and this is stressing me out because I have already taken out three of them and now another one is close to being totaled. Earlier today I ate something and I think it damaged them. I am tired of taking them out."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. At present, there is no way to prevent tooth decay in permanent teeth. The only alternative is to remove the tooth and replace it with an artificial substitute called dentures. Denture can be made from acrylic resin (plastic) or metal alloys such as gold, palladium, nickel, etc. They are designed to fit over the gums and provide a natural-looking smile. In some cases, however, dentures may need to be relined every few years to maintain a proper fit. Relining is a procedure done in the dentist office where new denture material is placed over the existing denture. It is not a complicated process and does not require any special preparation. You should consult your dentist for further information and treatment. Hope this helps. Take care."

222,"Hello doctor,I was suffering from minor Achilles tendinopathy and visited a physiotherapist today to get it checked. During the session, he performed some deep tissue massage on the calf (which was very tight) to relax it, which was very painful. After the massage, I experienced sharp pains while walking (which was not there beforehand), and when I brought this up with the physio, he said it was normal because it was the first time I had gotten deep tissue massage on that area.I have been icing the calf and resting, and while it has gotten a little better, it still hurts to walk. I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all. Is it normal to experience such pain after deep tissue massage to tight calf muscles, or did I sustain some injury (say a muscle strain or something similar) and need to get it checked out?", Hi thanks for asking question. In my opinion you should visit orthopedics doctor and go for complete examination. As deep tissue massage might have caused some trauma in your tendon. So it is better to rule out any soft tissue injury... If diagnosed then take rest and apply ice packs. Physical therapy exercises will help to improve range of motion and strengthening muscles around ankle and knee joint.... Hope it helps. Take care
223,"Hello doctor,Approximately one week ago, I had my wisdom teeth removed.

On the right side, healing is just fine, however, I noticed some white stuff lodged in the gum. I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome.I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone.I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket? And what is this small patch of irritated gum on my second molar? Any help is appreciated.I am currently on Celexa (for depression), 600 mg of Ibuprofen (for wisdom tooth pain).",1) The white matter stuck in your gum is most likely food remnants.2) The red spot on your second molar is most likely a minor irritation from the surgery.3) Do not try to remove any of the remaining food particles as it will only aggravate the condition.4) You should continue with your medications till the wound heals completely.5) Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.

235,"Hello doctor,I am a 27-year-old female. I have been on Depo-Provera for six years. I am not taking any other medications. Lately, I have been experiencing severe mood swings and have not been myself. One minute I am dancing around the room and could not be happier, the next I am either crying or very angry. Normally, I do not cry and I am usually pretty laid back. I have also been getting dizzy mostly when I stand up or walk up the stairs. I have trouble sleeping and or sleeping too much. I am hungry all the time, however, when I do eat I feel nausea. I have done some research and have found that these symptoms are both common with the injection and also with pregnancy. How do I tell, if these are pregnancy symptoms or if it is because of the Depo shot? I did miss my last shot three months ago. Last month I took a home pregnancy test it came back negative. Will a home test be enough to tell if I am pregnant or not?"," Hi, Thanks for posting your query. The symptoms you have mentioned can be due to Depo Provera injection but there is no way to confirm this as there is no blood test available to detect the presence of progesterone in blood. A urine pregnancy test will help to exclude pregnancy. In case you are still having doubts you can go for serum Chat Doctor test which will give you an accurate result. Hope this helps."

240,"Hi doctor,I had a month old twin baby girls. They were born in the 34th week of pregnancy. One baby was 2.2 Kg, and the other was a little weaker weighing 2 Kg. Since there is not enough mother\s milk after several attempts, I had to go for artificial milk powder. Initially, as suggested by the hospital pediatrician, they were given Dexolac Special Care, but after 20th day when their weight was around 2.4 Kg, they were given to Dexolac Premium 1. Out of the 2 babies, the weaker baby is responding well and quickly gaining weight (taking around 75 ml milk every 3 hours). But the baby which was born stronger is not drinking sufficient milk (45 ml in one feed, at an interval of around 3 hours), and is taking around an hour to take one feed. Also, she is having issues of gas and constipation. Because of constipation, she keeps crying. Now, this baby is not gaining weight and seem to be weaker. Please suggest what we can do in this case and shall we switch her milk to Lactogen or some other company?","1) The reason why your child is not gaining weight could be because he/she is not taking adequate milk. 2) As per your description it seems that the child has low appetite. The cause of low appetite could be due to many reasons like - poor suckling technique, gastronomic reflux, emotional distress, etc. 3) I would suggest you to consult with a pediatrician who will examine your kid and give you proper guidance. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
241,"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old. I am married. I have a bit problem in my sexual life. Whenever I insert my penis in her vagina she told me that when I insert full penis in her she feels pain. Is it normal or not?",1) Yes its normal to feel some amount of pain during initial penetration.2) But if this is happening every time then it needs further evaluation.3) The most common cause for this could be the hymen which causes burning sensation. This can be due to improper lubrication of the vaginal wall. It will improve with more and more practice. So don't worry.4) Another possibility is the tightness of the vagina.5) Also one needs to know that there may be some other reason like cervical cancer etc. so I suggest visiting a gynecologist who can examine the lady and give a proper diagnosis. Hope this answers your question.

243,"Hi doctor,I went for an annual health checkup and found there was a minor change in the ECG. I am 28 years old. My weight is 80 kg and height is 163 cm. My BMI is 30 and waist circumference is 90. My BP 130/90 mmHg. I am also attaching my ECG report to you. I need your suggestion. Thank you.",1) The ECG indicates a mildly elevated heart rate of about 74 beats per minute (bpm). This is normal for age and gender. It may be due to anxiety or some other cause like thyroid dysfunction or excessive caffeine intake.2) Your blood pressure reading is slightly high but it is still within the normal range. You should monitor your blood pressure at least once daily for one week and then discuss with your physician if this needs any treatment.3) Your waist circumference is slightly above the normal limit. A waist circumference greater than 94 cm in men and 80 cm in women increases the risk of coronary artery disease.4) Your BMI is slightly above the normal range. BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and BMI greater than 30 is obese.5) There is no need for concern as long as all your other parameters

After that she is not drinking breastmilk and formula too. Now only drinks at night time while sleeping. What should I do?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As your child is 5 months old and had fever after vaccination, it could be due to some infection or allergy to food, which can be taken care by giving antibiotics and anti-allergic medicines.

So get done CBC, if needed, go for bone marrow examination. Hope this will help you. Wishing good health to your kid. Thanks."
245,"Hello doctor,I am a 61 year old female and a diabetic for the last ten years. I had a cystocele repair surgery along with hysterectomy and cervix and ovaries removal five months ago. There is a slight discharge on and off. I did a urine culture now and found that there was a colony of Enterococcus faecalis. Please let me know if this is serious and whether I have to take a course of antibiotics for it. I do not have any symptoms of UTI or abscess etc. Also, the cystocele repair was not a success as the bladder is still at the mouth of the vagina. Please also let me know if anything can be done to put the bladder back in place. If this is not done, what are the repercussions?",1) Enterococcal bacteria usually cause no harm unless they get into your bloodstream.2) You need to take an antibiotic like vancomycin to clear up the infection.3) A successful repair of the cystocele depends upon the size of the defect and the amount of scar tissue.4) In some cases the bladder needs to be moved back into its normal position by doing a procedure called a sling.5) Usually the cystocele gets better over time but may require more than one operation.
246,"Hi doctor,I have been with the same partner for 8 years now. During these all 8 years I have had several UTIs with some leading to severe kidney infections. Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive. The doctor prescribed me seven days Nitrofurantoin antibiotics which cleared the pain and seemed gone entirely. Unfortunately two days later, the symptoms came back (please note that I had sex with my partner the day before) with burning sensation when urinating and painful when standing with the need to go toilet every 2 to 3 minutes. I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics.But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI. I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia at the beginning of this same relationship and was treated for it. My partner was also tested, but his results came back negative. Is it possible that the treatment that I had for Chlamydia 8 years ago did not clear it entirely and this lead to several UTIs and kidney infections? And also, would the antibiotics for UTI clear Chlamydia? Thank you in advance for your help.","1. In your case, there is no doubt that the cause of repeated UTI is Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of urethra and bladder wall. The symptoms you describe are typical of Chlamydia infection.2. This is why I advise you to take azithromycin or doxycycline for 7-10 days. These medications are effective against chlamydia infection.3. If you do not take any medicines and start sexual activity with another person, the infection will recur again.4. The antibiotic you took earlier might not have cured the infection completely. So you should repeat the course of medicine.5. You should continue using condoms during sexual activity till the infection has completely subsided."

In the past, I have been operated for endometriosis level 4. As usual, the gynecologist is suggesting a hysterectomy. But since I am in my perimenopausal phase, can the fibroids shrink with medication? I have been suggested Fibroease.","1) Yes, by taking medicine like fibroase.2) However, it will take time to show effect.3) Also, your condition will be monitored by trans-vaginal sonogram to see whether there is any reduction or not. 4) You should also know that if there is no improvement after six months then only surgery is recommended.5) So don't rush into surgery without a proper counseling from expert gynecologists."

She was 5 lbs 10 ounces at birth and was healthy (did not have to stay in the NICU). She hit all of her milestones in terms of rolling over, crawling and walking (walked at 14.5 months), but is a toe walker. Her left leg (to us) is weaker than her right and her left leg does not bend as much as her right leg. She began to speak around 10 months of age then her speech left. We came to find out she had chronic fluid and a month back she had tubes placed. I am hearing more vowel and consonants now but no true words yet. She makes fine eye contact. Her non-verbal communication is good. She responds to her name but not always. She is beginning to learn more of what we are saying, she plays with some toys, is not terribly social.

Epididymis is a small coiled tube at the back of each testicle which stores and carries sperm from the testicles to the vas deferens. Inflammation of epididymis causes pain and swelling over the scrotum.2) Testicular torsion is when the testicle twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply.3) Orchids is inflammation of the testicle, causing pain and redness.4) Testicular cancer can also cause pain in one or both testicles.5) There are many other conditions that can cause testicle pain including STDs, prostatitis, kidney stones, etc."

251,"Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old female. I have a minor issue. About a month and a half ago, there was an incident where the condom broke.

On the third day, there was a slight discharge which was brown in color. On the fourth day, there was some bleeding, but not at night. Today would be day five, and I still do not see blood.

I did home pregnancy tests, and it came back negative. It has been a month and 18 days now, since the intercourse."," The symptoms may be related to the use of emergency contraception.

As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.","1. The RAST test is very specific and usually accurate. However, the sensitivity of the test depends upon the level of antibody in your blood. So when they say that the level of allergen is less than certain amount, it doesn't mean that you will not be reactive to it. You may be mildly or moderately reactive to it. 2. Angiodema is not a common complication of food allergy and anaphylaxis. It is more likely to occur due to insect stings or some medications like beta-blockers etc."

266,"Hello doctor,I have rheumatoid arthritis. There is a long waiting list to see a rheumatologist in my place. I am thinking of seeing a private doctor but I have limited funds. How often would I need to see a rheumatologist? I cannot afford it every week or maybe every few months. How often do you think I need a doctor visit? I am hoping to be prescribed a DMARD like Methotrexate. Then when my slot comes up with the NHS I will go there.I take Naproxen which is not enough and I had a cortisone injection in my knee a couple of months ago. The swelling did not go down completely but I walked better. It has worn off now, and I have pain in more joints and a feeling of lumps under my feet. I am on a special diet and my CRP, ESR and high rheumatoid factor have gone down by half. But lately, I feel unwell. I would like to know the frequency of visits needed."," Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned that your RA is well controlled as per the inflammation markers, and you have been taking naproxen for some time.

267,"Hello doctor,Due to the use of Skinlite, I have sunburn on my face and now it looks like the dark spot. But I am using Kojivit gel for a dark spot. Is Kojivit gel good for the dark spot?"," Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Sunburn can be treated by application of mild steroid cream like HY Chat Doctor.  This helps in reducing redness and swelling. You can also apply calamine lotion or cool compresses over the affected areas. Do not expose yourself to sunlight until the healing is complete. Kojic acid is a lightening agent which can help in lightening pigmented spots, but it will take time to show result. It should not be used alone as it may cause skin irritation.

269,"Hello doctor,My wife and I had some argument about my past. I had lied to her about the number of sex partners I had. That hurts her because she explained that her perception of me was built on the fact that she knew that I only had a few sex partners.We have been discussing this for months, but now after having these discussions and arguments, I realize that when we are to have sex, I get anxious. I will get an erection, but when its time to enter, it falls. I want to know, how to get my mind to a place of not over thinking so that I am not distracted. Kindly help.","1) First, your anxiety is the result of guilt and worry. When you lie, you feel guilty and worry about getting caught in the act. This causes anxiety which then leads to performance anxiety during sexual encounters.2) Second, anxiety can be reduced by relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises.3) Third, if you do not have any physical problems with achieving or maintaining an erection, then it may be related to psychological factors. You need to go see a therapist who specializes in treating men with sexual dysfunction.4) Fourth, if you do have physical issues with achieving or maintaining an erection, then you should consult a urologist for further evaluation.5) Lastly, you should also consider couples counseling which can help both of you to understand each other better and improve communication in your relationship."

I am currently on Gabapentin, Codeine, and Paracetamol.","1) The pain and tightness in your buttocks, thighs, and legs can be due to compression of the sciatic nerve at its origin from L4-L5 vertebrae. This could explain why you have pain radiating down the back of the leg.2) There is no specific treatment for this condition as such.

274,"Hello doctor, I have observed a white smegma on my penis head. There were irritation and red bumps on it before, but I oiled it so now I do not have any pain or irritation. But in the morning the white smegma is still there and my foreskin is hard and rough. What should I do? Please help.","100% welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I am sorry about your problem. You need to take care of this problem as soon as possible because it may lead to serious complications. Smegma is a natural lubricant that keeps the area around the glans of the penis moist and protected from friction and injury. It is produced by the sebaceous glands present in the skin of the penis. The normal color of smegma varies depending upon the amount of exposure to air. It can range from light yellowish-brown to black. It is common for people to notice more smegma when they are sexually aroused. This is due to increased secretion of sebum from the sebaceous glands. White smegma means that there is something wrong with your body, either it is an allergy or some other disease. I suggest you go to your physician for examination and proper treatment."

276,"Hello doctor,Last night and today I have been experiencing a sharp pain just left of the sternum which is not deep, seemingly on top of the rib where it joins the sternum. It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now. Usually, my resting heart rate is under 67. Currently, I am on Lorazepam 2 mg, Prevacid 15 mg and baby Aspirin.",1) The pain you described is most likely due to acid reflux disease. You can try PPI medications like omeprazole 20 mg once daily or pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily. This should help control your symptoms. 2) Your current medications are appropriate for your conditions. But you should discuss with your doctors about changing the frequency of aspirin. It is recommended to take only once per day. 3) Your HR is slightly elevated but seems to be stable without any arrhythmia. You should not worry about it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

296,"Hello doctor,I recently tested positive for HIV and had a viral load test which was 160k and CD4 count of 145. My issue now is with how I could have contracted the virus. I have had three sexual partners and there was always protection. Two tested negatives after I informed them about my results and the last and most recent is insisting he is not ready and it was protected all the way. Although we did have anal at times and I cannot be 100 % sure that the condom was there. I have also had a parasitic infection which affects my scalp for a couple of years. Is it possible for something to mimic HIV in tests? I have been to the dentist thrice in all my life for an extraction and checkups. I also had an appendicectomy 13 years back. I have had occasional IV therapy and a few injections. I have never shown any symptoms. I am also anemic."," Hi dear, HIV can be transmitted through unprotected sex, needle sharing, blood transfusion or accidental prick by infected needles. It can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The possibility of transmission via dental procedure is very less as per the data available. You should know that the immune system is damaged by the virus only when it reaches the lymph nodes where the cells are destroyed. So if your viral load is high then you might get infected, so I will advise you to start treatment early to prevent further damage to the body. Thanks"

He ordered some blood work and told me everything is fine. And he told me to see the rheumatologist once for my peace of mind.I have attached my report. Do you see anything abnormal in my blood report? What is the cause of my body pain? Is anything wrong with my body? Do I have any underlying conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, or any other cancer? Do I have any liver disease or thyroid disease that can lead me to pain? Before three months I did a blood test and my rheumatoid factor was 8.1 iu/ml and now it is 11 iu/ml. Why it is going up with a short duration of time? What do I need to do?I am eating healthy and getting good sleep but I am not losing weight. My vitamin D level is 40ng/ml and I am taking vitamin B12. I am taking vitamin D for almost one year. I m taking 4000 IU for five days a week. Please explain in detail the treatment plan."," Hi there. Thanks for your question at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern regarding these symptoms. Firstly, let me tell you that what you have mentioned here is not sufficient information to make a diagnosis. The symptoms of yours are suggestive of a possible inflammation process in the body. But, without knowing the clinical history and physical examination, it is difficult to come to a conclusion. You must get yourself assessed by a physician who would examine you and then come to a conclusion after doing investigations like complete blood count, ESR, USG etc. In case if you have a positive family history of autoimmune diseases, then this could be a possibility. There are various causes of body pains. The most common causes are muscle spasms, joint pains, gastric problems, backache, anxiety etc. But, before coming to a conclusion, I would suggest you to consult a physician who will look"
299,"Hi doctor,I am worried about ALS. I have had a twitch in my left hypothenar muscle intermittently for three weeks or so. Perhaps a few twitches per hour followed by hours of no twitching. I also have twitches in other parts of my body quite regularly though this one is focal and the others are diffuse. I have not dropped anything. Doing self-tests, my left pinky seems a bit weaker. Though I think I have atrophy in the hypothenar, I have had three general practice doctors tell me it is just asymmetrical with my dominant right hand. The doctors have also performed basic finger strength tests (spread fingers and resist ) and they say they are normal. Reflexes are normal. No tripping, dropping, slurring, etc. Should I be worried about this given the above scenario and that doctors have told me no atrophy and no weakness? Thank you."," Hi there, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. You need to consult your neurologist who will examine you and order an EMG/NCV as well as blood workup to rule out any possible causes of your symptoms. It may be related to vitamin B12 deficiency or any metabolic problem. Also, if you are taking any medication then you might want to check with your doctor if these may cause any type of side effects which could lead to such symptoms. In any case, you should not worry too much, but it is best to get checked up. Hope this helps!"
300,"Hello doctor,I am 53 years old, and have quit smoking 19 years ago. I still have a chronic cough. Each specialist tells me something different.

I do not have diminished lung capacity or problem in breathing, no wheezing, out of breath when I run but, I am overweight and out of shape. What do you think?"," Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have COPD. Yes, it causes cough. But it does not cause cough to be present all the time as you have. It depends upon degree of obstructive lesion. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."

I went to a doctor and he gave me a vitamin tablet. But, I did not get any cure with that. Then I visited a dermatologist and he gave me Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% and no improvement with that too. Now he has given me the same ointment along with tablets Medrol, Biotin and Celin. Now I feel it has progressed to my upper lip also. Could you please tell me how to cure this? I am so desperate for this to be over. I am under lot of stress because of this. By the way the time when it started, I was under stress. I have searched in internet and I found that many people have been having this problem for many years. Some cured with anxiety medication and some by leaving alone. What shall I do for this?"," Hi, thanks for writing your query. I understand your concern regarding the condition of peeling of lips. The treatment depends upon the cause of the condition. There are few conditions which could lead to such symptoms. They include-contact dermatitis (allergic reaction), eczema, lichen planus or other autoimmune conditions like pemphigoid etc. The most common cause of peeling lips is trauma/ friction.

303,"Hello doctor,I am a 21-year-old female. I have preauricular pits, that have drained smelly discharge ever since I was born. I have them in both ears. The right does not drain often. The left drains every day more than once a day. The left has become really swollen and painful recently. I am not sure of what to do because I now understand that the discharge means it is infected and it is hard for the surgery, if infected. Plus they have been infected for so long. I have also read that after surgery, it could reoccur."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you describe your problem, it seems to be an ear infection with accumulation of pus, which needs to be treated by antibiotics. As you mention that the left ear is painful, I would suggest you to consult a surgeon or ENT specialist. You can take an appointment with him/her, and he may treat it with an incision and curettage. It will remove the excess pus from the cavity and will help to reduce the pain. Hope this information helps you. Thank you."
304,"Hello doctor,I was on a course of Deviry 10 mg for 5 days as I missed my period last month but I am not pregnant. How many days does it take to get my period now?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As your Deviated 10 mg is an oral contraceptive pill that can prevent ovulation and therefore conception, so if you miss your periods by a day or two, it cannot be due to Deviated 10 mg. So I would advise you to consult a gynecologist and undergo some tests like ultrasound scan of abdomen, blood tests for prolactin levels, thyroid profile, urine test for sugar, etc., and accordingly he will treat you. Hope this helps."
305,"Hi doctor,I had a cavity in the tooth. The X-rays show it was small but when the dentist drilled the nerve got exposed and is telling me I need a root canal along with crown. He has put a temporary filling for now. How do I know if I need a root canal for sure?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. You have to get done an x-ray of the tooth after removal of the temporary filling. Then only we can judge whether there is any infection or not. If there is no infection then you don't need to go for Root Canal Treatment. In case there is some infection then you should go for Root Canal treatment. It will be better if you consult another Dentist for opinion. Hope this helps. Take care."
306,"Hello doctor,My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer early this year. She underwent MRM surgery and now undergoing chemotherapy. Her age is 57, and the doctor advised for eight cycles of chemotherapy. Now she completed five cycles, and now the doctor had advised 17 more injections for hormone blocking. We find 17 more injections are too much and will be highly stressful for my mother. Could you please suggest an alternative treatment.I have attached a few essential reports for your reference. Please let me know if you need any more details.","17 injections of any medicine are not easy to take by anyone but especially by a person who has already gone through a lot. The only alternative that I can think of is to use other medicines like tamoxifen or Arimidex (anastrozole) instead of leuprolide acetate. These medications are also hormonal blockers and work similarly so they may be substituted for each other. However, the decision should be taken after consultation with her doctor because he knows best what is right for his patients."
307,"Hello doctor,If both the testes experience a reduction in blood supply (and thus oxygen and hormones), in the long run will it increase the risk of more spontaneous mutation present in sperms as lesser blood supply will affect the DNA replication and repairing ability of spermatogonial cells?"," Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Yes, reduced blood supply to the testicles can lead to increased chance of genetic abnormalities in sperms. As the blood supply is reduced, there is less oxygen and nutrients available to the testicles, which leads to decrease in the number of sperm producing cells (spermatogonia) in the testis. These cells divide into other types of cells which give rise to germ cells like spermatocytes and spermatids. Increase in number of these cells leads to chromosomal abnormality in sperms, which may be transmitted to offspring leading to genetic disorders. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."
308,"Hi doctor,My chief complaint is severe lower back pain and pain in upper thighs. My medical history is as follows. Carcinoma of the breast three years back, followed by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. I am on Tamoxifen for past 3 years, and now I am taking Arimidex. I have been suffering from osteoporosis for over 7 years. Before six years, I had severe osteopenia with maximum bone loss of 21% on L3 and spine, ribs, trunk, and arms with more on the left side.I had undergone the following investigations. Before three years, I had FNAC which showed invasive ductal carcinoma, right breast ER+, PR+, Hercep score ""0."" Last month, I had an x-ray and MRI, which showed focal altered marrow intensity lesions seen in B/L pelvic bone, sacrum, and left upper femoral shaft consistent with metastasis. I also had a PET scan which showed metabolically active ill-defined lytic destructive lesions in post cortex shaft of left femur, right inferior pubic ramus, B/L iliac bones, sacrum, D5, 7, 11 and L1, 4, sternum, right 3, 5, 7 post ribs with mid-right paravertebral soft tissue lesion at D7 level likely metastasis.","1) Osteoporosis is due to low calcium intake and lack of physical activity. You should take calcium supplements and do regular exercise.2) The treatment depends upon the type of cancer. For example, if it is breast cancer then you will need hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors).3) The other possible cause could be due to radiation therapy. Radiation induced fibrosis can occur after radiation therapy for many types of cancer including breast, prostate, thyroid, lung and skin cancer. It causes chronic pain and stiffness in the joints and muscles. In your case, the symptoms may be due to this. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

My current doctor thinks it is bicornuate but I am going to do a 3D ultrasound in the middle of my next cycle to get a better idea. I have MRI and hysteroscopy photos to provide. I have had two missed miscarriages, the last one hemorrhaged two days before going septic and sent me to the ER for five days. I have also been diagnosed with a placental site nodule on my right side where both pregnancies have been. Could my problem be surgically corrected?Currently, we are going through genetic, blood clotting disorder, and menstrual cycle/hormone monitoring. Genetic counselor said low risk for any genetic causes but is still waiting to complete the blood tests which should be done in four weeks, same for the blood clotting tests.","1) The arcuate uterus has an elliptical shape instead of being a circle. It appears as if a part of the uterus is missing, when viewed from above. 2) Bicornuate uterus is a congenital malformation of the uterus that occurs in about 4% of women. It looks like there is a cleft or split in the uterus into two parts. This can cause problems with implantation and early pregnancy loss. 3) A placental site nodule is a benign lesion that usually presents as a single, smooth, raised lesion in the lower uterine segment. It may be associated with increased risk of preterm birth, but this needs to be confirmed by further evaluation."

Please advice."," Hi there,The current levels of your hormones are within normal range, so you need not worry about them. However, if you want to conceive, it is best to try to keep the level of TSH below 2.5. This can be achieved by reducing the dose of Eltroxin or increasing the dose of levothyroxine. In addition, you should also increase the dose of vitamin B12 (injection) as well as folic acid supplementation. The other issue that needs attention is your weight. You should aim to maintain a body mass index between 18.5-24.9 kg/m^2. As long as you have no other health issues such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you should be able to conceive without any problems. Hope this helps."

334,"Hello doctor,I have had four follicles ruptured from my left ovary and one from the right. I have had IUI back to back for two consecutive days. But my major concern is I have a unicornate uterus with a left rudimentary horn. I recently had lap because I had a cyst on my right ovary. The doctor says I have been ovulating perfectly every time. I am depressed abt the fact that left tube is absent but four follicles ruptured on the same side. Please give me some hope of getting pregnant. The endometrium lining is 9 mm which the doctor said is very good. And, this is my first IUI after lap.","1) Unicornuate uterus with one rudimentary horn can cause difficulty in conceiving as it may not allow the fertilized egg to enter into the uterine cavity.2) In your case, since there was no tubal blockage, it seems that all the eggs were released into the fallopian tube. This means that you should be able to get pregnant provided the eggs are fertilized (which is possible if they meet up with sperms).3) It is better to consult an infertility specialist who would guide you about the possibility of conception and the treatment options available."

337,"Hello doctor,I suppose to get the sleeve bariatric surgery and I was taking Adepix and I stopped it a week ago. My surgeon told me he thinks I have to be off Adepix for three months before surgery. I only took it for three weeks. Is this true? He said it may interfere with anesthesia?","1. Yes, your surgeon is correct.3-month gap between Adepix use & surgery is recommended.2. No, Adepix does not affect anesthesia. It can cause problems with anesthetics if used during surgical procedure as it can make the anesthetic less effective. But that is not the case here.3. In general, any medication that is used in long term should be stopped at least 7 days prior to surgery. This gives body time to metabolize it fully and also reduces risk of interaction with other medications or anesthetics.4. Please do not worry. Your surgeon has done his job properly."

I went to the first doctor and he tried me on muscle relaxants, nothing changed so he referred me to a specialist. The specialist had a quick feel and then told me it was normal, that I should not worry and that I would have to get used to it. He also implied it has been happening since the operation and I just did not notice.There is still no pain, only discomfort (it varies) normally when I walk. I think that my right testicle is a tiny bit swollen and slightly squishier than my left and while I could live with this, I really do not want to. Though I have suffered no injuries to my testicles recently, I actually think that one of my stitches has come loose as I can feel the end on the stitch lump where I could not before.

339,"Hello doctor,I weaned off of 40 mg of Paroxetine very slowly but my sleep was impacted and as of two months, I have been suffering from extreme insomnia. I have gone back to medication and I am currently on 20 mg of Paroxetine and 10 mg of Fluoxetine, but my insomnia has continued. I was prescribed Ativan (0.5 mg) for sleep, and it sometimes helps, but not always. Even if I take a bit more (I have taken up to .75 total), it does not always help me sleep. My psychiatrist prescribed Trazodone (she suggested I start at 25 mg and if I feel no effect, to take another 25 mg/ go up to 50 mg in one night (but I am concerned about serotonin syndrome from taking another medication that messes with Serotonin). Can you advise if I should be concerned about serotonin syndrome if I take the 25 (or 50) mg of Trazodone? Additionally, should I be concerned about anything else in terms of taking these three medications together?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The dose of trazodone is usually started at 12.5 mg and then increased by 12.5 mg every 3-4 days after monitoring for side effects like hypotension or sedation. So don't worry about the dosage. However, it is important to know that it could cause some dizziness, blurred vision, orthostatic hypotension etc. You need to monitor your blood pressure when you take this medication. It is also important to note that this medication can interact with other Chat Doctor.  So before starting any new medication, you need to discuss all the possible side effects of the medicines with your doctor."
340,"Hi doctor,I am 24 and having an active sexual life. I have two questions. First I have noticed that my performance is erratic as in there are times when I can last 5-6 minutes and then the very next day it can go to 30-35 minutes. It is different with different partners. Second and more alarming is that I have been experiencing a stinging pain in my scrotum on the left side it usually happens when I stand up while sitting or laying and sometimes while walking. I tried finding the source of the pain by pressing in different regions but could not find one. Also, it happens at the back side of the scrotum. It is limited to the left side and has been increasing with each passing day. I thought of UTI, but my pee does not burn. Can I have some suggestions for my problems? Thank you.",1) Your problem may be due to your anxiety about performance. This will affect your performance and you will feel anxious even before intercourse. You should try to avoid such situations. 2) The stinging sensation is likely due to inflammation of the skin. You need to take anti-inflammatory medicines like diclofenac sodium twice daily for few days. 3) You also need to check if you are suffering from any sexually transmitted disease (STD). Get yourself checked for STD and treat accordingly.
341,"Hello doctor,The gums where my wisdom tooth is present is in pain."," Hi, I am sorry that your wisdom teeth are causing you pain and discomfort. The wisdom teeth erupt at an angle towards the opposing molar and if there is not enough space for them then they get impacted or stuck in the jaw bone. This can cause swelling, pain and difficulty with chewing due to pressure on adjacent teeth. You need to visit a dentist for treatment. In some cases extraction of the wisdom teeth may be required. Please do not delay as this will only worsen the situation."
342,"Hi doctor,I had unprotected sex with my partner without any penetration. I rubbed my penis over her vagina. I might have a little semen present in it. She usually has a periods cycle of 33 to 35 days. But her periods got delayed this month. Is she pregnant? Why is there a delay in her periods? Is there any typical food available to bring her periods on time?","1) You should be aware that pre-cum contains sperm and can result in pregnancy if ejaculated into the vagina.2) It is possible for your girlfriend to get pregnant, but unlikely. The reason being is that it takes about 7 days before ovulation occurs after the start of her period, so even though she may have had intercourse near the time of ovulation (which is when fertilization is most likely), it is still not likely that she would be pregnant. 3) In general, having unprotected sex during the first week of a menstrual cycle will increase the chance of becoming pregnant compared to other times in the cycle because ovulation occurs around day 14 of the cycle. 4) There is no specific diet that can help induce a period. However, some women find that eating more fruits and vegetables helps regulate their cycles."
343,"Hi doctor,I am a 20 year old girl and have a small vaginal opening. My husband and I hardly have sex because it hurts me so badly. What can I do to stop it from being so painful?","1) Please get an examination done by your gynecologist for any possible abnormality in your genital tract like polyp/fibroid/endometriosis etc., 2) The best way to avoid pain during intercourse is to use the pillow under the hips and lie down on the back with the pelvis raised up. This will reduce the pressure on the vagina and make penetration easier.3) Another option would be to try different sexual positions. Try lying on your side or stomach instead of the back. This may help to create more space between the vagina and rectum as well as decrease the weight of the vagina on the cervix.4) Avoid using lubricants and condoms which can further aggravate the problem.5) Always start with foreplay before penetrative sex. Foreplay helps relax the muscles in the vagina and makes them less sensitive"

It is difficult without knowing your full history to make any conclusions about what could be causing these symptoms.

Is there something else besides the vomiting that could have caused the bruised eyelids?","1) If he is taking any medication or blood thinner (Anti-coagulant), then it can cause bleeding in eyes.2) Due to the vomiting, the blood vessels in eyes get dilated and hence they appear red.3) It can be due to allergic reaction as well.4) The most common cause of this condition is called ""Conjunctival Pemphigoid"" which is an autoimmune disease where antibodies attack conjunctiva causing redness, swelling, pain and tearing.5) In such cases, the best treatment option is to apply steroid eye drops under your doctors guidance. Hope this helps you. Thanks!"
368,"Hello doctor,I had a chest x-ray and chest ct scan done. And they both came back normal. If I had emphysema would it have shown up on one of those two tests?"," Hi, Dear,Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. Navigate through my answer. Emphysema is not visible on X-ray or CT scan. It might be seen if there is an infection of lungs like pneumonia, which can lead to consolidation (collection of pus) in lung. So, your test results are normal. You need to consult pulmonologist for clinical examination and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will help in diagnosis of emphysema along with other diseases like asthma, bronchitis etc. Hope above information helps you. If you find this reply helpful do rate it. Thank you."
369,"Hi doctor,My daughter is 9 years old. She gets nose bleeding once in few months and also gum bleeding. She complains about occasional back pain, stomach burning, and hip pain too. My family physician has written down a series of tests and asked me to get opinions from a hematologist, gastroenterologist, and an orthopedic doctor respectively.","1) A blood test for hemophilia should be done for her if she is not taking any treatment for it.2) Also, a bone scan can rule out infection or other causes of bony pain.3) An esophagogastroduodenoscopy will help exclude peptic ulcer disease or some irritation from acid reflux.4) A colonoscopy will rule out inflammatory bowel disease.5) For pain relief, I would recommend that she take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief."

Presently, I am using medicines for BP - Tenormin 50 mg and also for depression - Aplog 2 mg, Pethidine 50 mg and Mirtaz 15 mg for the past 10 years. My problem of ED and EE is from past five years. For this, I have used Suhagra tablet 50 to 100 mg and some sprays and Tantex capsules but there is no use. I am facing an embarrassing situation. Kindly give me an instant solution to this problem.","1) You may require a complete sexual health check-up which includes blood tests, urine tests, physical examination by a specialist, and possibly even psychological assessment. This would help determine if any physical or mental issues are contributing to your problems. 2) Medications like Cialis (Tadalafil), Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate), or Levitra (Vardenafil Hydrochloride) can be taken as needed before sexual activity. These medications work in different ways to increase blood flow to the penis when you become sexually aroused.3) Your diet should include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and good fats. Avoid high-fat foods, fast foods, sugary snacks, and processed foods.4) Exercise regularly at least 4 times a week for 30 minutes each session. This"
371,"Hi doctor,I am a 19-year-old female. I lost my virginity about 10 months ago with my boyfriend. Now after 10 months has passed I found out that I have two warts inside my vagina. It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly?Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again?If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again? If I decided to buy the Gardasil injection and injected it now, then the next after two months, then next after six months, but during this time can I have sex with my boy friend? Will the vaccine still work?","1. No, HPV is a common problem among young people. Most people who have it never know they have it because they never develop any problems or symptoms.  2. You should be screened for other STDs like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. 3. Yes, condom may protect against some STDs, but it won't protect against HPV. 4. You cannot get rid of HPV by using condyloma paints. 5. The best way to prevent HPV is to practice safe sex including the use of condoms. 6. Gardasil prevents most strains of HPV. 7. Yes, you can resume having sex with your boyfriend."
372,"Hello doctor,I am a 25-year-old male and I have never been able to fully retract my penis. I have severe phimosis. I know phimosis can be treated, but my biggest concern is that I now have blue-looking veins from the shaft of my penis to the actual penis head that is supposed to be exposed. Is it serious? I have an appointment with a urologist in two weeks but the suspense is really killing me. Is it common? or can it be treated? Will I be able to successfully retract the penis head? I also feel pain sensation when I touch the hole at the tip of the penis. Please help. Of note, I smoke marijuana. I have attached photos for your reference.","1) There are many causes of phimosis. The most common cause is constriction of the opening due to tight foreskin (preputial adhesions). This can be caused by trauma, poor hygiene, infection or inflammation. It can occur as a result of allergic reaction to certain substances such as soap, bubble bath, underwear etc., or may be genetically inherited. In some cases, the opening may not close properly after birth.2) Phimosis is usually diagnosed by physical examination. You need to see a physician who will examine your penis to confirm the diagnosis.3) Treating phimosis involves removing the prepuce (foreskin) and cutting away any scar tissue present. This is known as circumcision.4) Blue colored veins around the glans are normal in appearance and are related to blood circulatory system. They do not indicate"

My daily dose is 32.5 units Lantus at 10 AM and 12.5 units at 8 PM, with a sliding scale for Novolog (typically 0 to 6 units). What dosage or schedule would you recommend for temporarily relying on Novolog only?","1) For type 1 diabetes, the recommended treatment is insulin therapy.2) You need to give yourself regular injections of insulin throughout the day according to your blood sugar levels.3) The amount of insulin depends upon the blood sugar levels at different times of the day and also on other factors like age, weight and physical activity.4) The most common types of insulins used are rapid acting insulin (such as Novorapid) which is given before meals. Long-acting insulin (such as Humalog or Lantus) which is given once or twice each day.5) In case if you miss any injection then take that dose immediately after you remember it and then continue with the regular schedule.6) To know more about diet and exercise regimen consult a physician."
374,"Hello doctor,I am a 57-year-old female. Here is my question constant heart palpitations and fluttering, continuous feeling of adrenaline rushing along with palpitations very bad at night but also during the day when sitting in doing nothing palpitations often make you feel nauseous on a 1 to 10 scale they are about an eight. All labs are normal ECG, echo, and Holter monitor are all normal.Doctor cannot figure it out and prescribed Propranolol 10 mg, told me to try these once a day. Yesterday after doctor visits heart palpitations for four hours got fed up and took one tablet one hour later, all palpitations and adrenaline rush was gone. Slept for the first time without being woke up having to cough to stop the palpitations. Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed. Again all labs are good cholesterol not high on statins and warfarin. I must be perplexing to all doctors because they cannot figure it out. Was put on warfarin approximately 15 years ago due to DVTs as a result of a surgery, always therapeutic. So I had a heart attack or arrhythmia a few years back the angio came out the great doctor said everything looked fine now I have these crazy heart palpitations that would not stop. They go away as soon as I take the beta-blocker. I am told that beta-blockers even though anti-arrhythmic can also be pro arithmetic as well should I take this every day or should I only take this when I start to feel palpitations."," Hi, Palpitations and other symptoms are suggestive of anxiety. You are taking propranolol which is a beta blocker and is used to treat anxiety. It will control your symptoms till you take it. But if you stop using it, then your symptoms will come back. So, you can continue taking it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
375,"Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a ""slower moving bacteria"" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence? I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose.","1) MRSA is a superbug and is resistant to most of the antibiotics in use today. It is spread through direct contact with the skin lesions of someone carrying the bug or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Most hospitals routinely screen patients for MRSA colonization of their nasal cavity, mouth, and anal region.2) MRSA is usually resistant to penicillin and vancomycin, so if your infections were treated with those medications then you probably didn't have MRSA.3) You can take measures to avoid getting MRSA again like using hand sanitizer frequently, keeping your hands clean, doing regular baths with bleach water, avoiding contact with people who have visible skin lesions, wearing gloves when touching broken skin, etc. Hope this helps"
376,"Hello doctor,I am a sufferer of hemiplegic migraine. However, I had unusual collapses three months back. The first one was 40 minutes; I could not recall the whole of that period. I came back with an injured knee and felt dazed. I was fine after around two hours. The next day, I felt pressure in my head and as though I was about to die. I then could not recall getting home or the rest of the night. I was fine in the morning. Two days later, I felt horrendous pain in my head, felt like I was swimming, then tried to go home and again could not recall from deciding to go home to around two hours later and I was foggy for the rest of the night. I have had constant pain in the left side of my head above the temple for four years. It does not go. However, In the past two weeks, I have felt like it is throbbing and at times about to burst out. I was meant to see my neurologist three months back, but his receptionist did not follow the recommendation, and now I am unsure whether to have the tests done. I feel like we are playing with my life. Usually, I am pretty relaxed about the possibilities and know it is a migraine. But this feels different. This feels like intense throbbing above my ear from the temple along towards the back of my head, with a pain in my ear to just behind my jaw under my ear. My instinct says that an aneurysm needs ruling out. I do not know if I am just upset because it feels so different and this pressure is intense. It is a weird feeling. I currently take Sumatriptan as needed.Please, can you advise what to do? As it stands the next neuro appointment is after four months, added complication is that I have been breathless and unable to climb stairs without stopping and panting for past four months. I am having heart tests on the weekend. But, what do I do about my brain?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. Aneurysms need to be ruled out by Doppler ultrasound scan of the carotid artery. You should get your blood pressure checked regularly. This is important since high blood pressure can cause aneurysms. Please also check your cholesterol levels which may increase risk for aneurysm formation. Your symptoms seem to suggest migraines. There are medications available for them. Please get examined by a neurologist and discuss these options."

393,"Hi doctor,I had a frenuloplasty of the penis ten days back. It all seemed fine at first, and I had very little pain. I have to say the actual incision and stitches were a lot larger than what I was previously led to believe. I have been washing gently with salt water and rinsing twice daily. I took a good look a few days ago, and it seems that the stitches have come apart. To be honest, and I am not a urologist, but it does not look like a good job, though I may be wrong. I went to see the doctor yesterday, and she took a look and said that it all looks fine, the stitches may have come apart slightly. She told me to leave it for two weeks, and if I am still concerned, they will refer me back to the specialist. I was hoping to get a second opinion, this being my penis, I am obviously concerned that it is not going to heal properly and I will end up worse than before the operation. I am primarily looking for reassurance.","10 days post surgery is too early to assess the healing of soft tissues. The normal time required for complete healing is around 4-6 weeks.

Other causes for delay in periods include hormonal imbalance, thyroid disorder, obesity etc. You should consult a gynecologist for proper evaluation and treatment."
398,"Hello doctor,I often have elbow pain due to spending more time with computer and using a mouse or keyboard. I work 7 to 8 hours daily in computer and pain is gradually increasing. The pain earlier used to reduce by taking Voveran tablet and using Voveran gel. The pain has become frequent now and I am taking Tendoshot capsule for the last few days. I also use tennis elbow strap in both hands while working and that gives some comfort. I do a few elbow exercise but that seems not sufficient in reducing pain. What is the treatment for elbow pain due to computer use?Whether should I take Voveran 50 or Tendoshot for pain relief?Is there any other medicine to use for pain relief?Whether tennis elbow strap or sleeve will be appropriate for this purpose?How to prevent elbow pain while using the computer?How serious can be this elbow pain in future?","1) Tennis elbow straps are good for your elbows, but they won't help your wrists. 2) You need to rest your arms, especially the wrists. This means that you need to avoid typing as much as possible. Use voice recognition technology instead of a traditional keyboard and mouse. 3) For your elbows, you may want to try a TENS unit or an ultrasound machine. Neither of these are particularly expensive (probably less than $100), and they might help. 4) You should also consider getting physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles and help improve your range of motion. 5) If all else fails, then surgery might be considered. However, it would probably be best if you could get through this without surgery. Hope this helps"

400,"Hello doctor,My wife was previously diagnosed with bipolar II and was taking 100 mg Lamotrigine daily for depression maintenance. She was on that dosage for nine years. She recently suffered a more chronic depressive episode and went out of town for ketamine infusion therapy. The infusions were very successful, and the psychiatrist who was assessing her for the infusions suggested that she did not need the Lamotrigine, that it was ineffective for treating depression in bipolar II. She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult.It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine? Or does she need to get a booster shot of Ketamine? Both are difficult solutions. Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice."," Hi! I am so sorry to hear about your wifes problem! She may still be having an episode. I suggest that she gets evaluated by a good psychiatrist. It will be best if she can take the lamotrigine again as it is helping her a lot. If she is unable to tolerate the lamotrigine then other alternatives like bupropion or trazodone could help. However, these medications are not approved for use in bipolar disorder. Ketamine might also help but only temporarily. If she has a history of addiction then going back to ketamine might not be feasible. I hope this helps! Take care"

404,"Hi doctor,What is the difference between IntraLasik and Contoura Lasik?"," Both IntraLASIK and Contour LASIK are forms of laser-assisted refractive surgery that use an excimer laser to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism by reshaping the cornea. The main differences between these two procedures include the type of laser used, the amount of tissue removed, the accuracy of the procedure, the depth of correction possible, and the cost. IntraLASIK uses a femtosecond laser instead of a microkeratome to create a flap in the cornea. This laser is more precise than the microkeratome and can be programmed for individualized treatment plans. It also allows for greater depth of correction and is considered safer because it eliminates the possibility of an accidental cut caused by the microkeratome. Contour LASIK uses a different type of excimer laser. Its advantage over In"

For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline.

I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck.

Since then I have had no problems with it and had multiple x-rays to check on it.

428,"Hello doctor,I am a 41-year-old female and have been diagnosed with viral conjunctivitis by a specialist. My eye health is otherwise perfect (had them checked out a week before this came on). After a few days, it spread to the other eye. I expect the first eye will heal first, even though the second eye is not as bad. One question is when the first eye heals, do I need to protect it from re-infection from the one that is still healing?Also, on the typical length of healing, I am not quite at two weeks yet (this is day 11 for the first eye), but the lack of improvement in my condition is becoming frustrating to me. Today the vision in the first eye is smudgy, and the vision in the second eye is better, but not perfect. The specialist was aware of the vision problems, and she said that it was normal (though I think they have worsened).I was told this could take weeks to heal, beyond the normal one or two. How many weeks are weeks generally? I was told I have a mild to moderate case, but all I know is that I have seen no real progress, and I think the virus might have even spread to one of my sinuses.

I went to a neurologist, who told me to take Ecosprin. But, after taking one tablet, I feel numb and stuffy. There is no sensation in my lower part of the body starting from my stomach. I have attached my MRI and blood reports. Please assist."," Hi there, thanks for writing in. Numbness can be due to many reasons like vitamin deficiencies, peripheral neuropathy or nerve compression at different levels. Also check your BP and sugar levels. It would be good to get an EMG/NCV study done to rule out the cause. If any treatment has been prescribed by your treating doctor, do not stop abruptly. Hope this helps."
431,"Hello doctor,I was chewing tobacco for the past few years. And I stopped it forever. But sometimes I have a little throbbing on my gums. And the color of my gums changed to black. Is this any serious disease?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for writing your query. It is not possible in any way that the blackening of the gum can be due to the use of tobacco. The blackening of the gum can be due to the accumulation of calculus (tartar) on the teeth which is causing inflammation and pain in the gums. I would suggest you to visit a dentist nearby and get yourself examined. You may need an x-ray of your teeth as well. Hope I am able to resolve your doubts. Wishing you good health. Regards."
432,"Hello doctor,Looking for an opinion on tuberculosis skin test. Please answer if you have experience with PPD skin tests. I am 34 years old, former cigarette smoker. My friend got diagnosed with tuberculosis due to strong arthritis medications, and I have had some contact with him. I have attached images of my skin test below."," Hi, I would like to know which part of your body you had this test done? The test is positive only when there is a reaction at least 10 mm in size. There should be no other lesion in that area as well. You might need to repeat the test after few weeks. If it still remains positive then you will require further investigations including chest X-ray. You can discuss with your physician regarding this. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more queries."
433,"Hello doctor,I am 22 years old. I have been on the following antidepressants for two years. Morning: Modapex 50 one pill, Depakene, Lamotrigine 25 mg one pill. Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours. Even those 70 hours, they are full of nightmares and I usually wake up after two hours with my mind confused and afraid and I cannot sleep back. I want to sleep. My eyes grew tired because I have been opening them for way too long. I do not want to give in and get back to the drugs because I am sick of them and I have had enough. I am not going back but I also want to sleep. Just a single continuous eight hours of sleep without any nightmares. I usually get nightmares that are very weird. I do not even know how to describe them. Mathematical problems and complicated solutions that are presented to me (in my sleep) and I keep thinking about them until my head hurts and I wake up freaked out. Please tell me what to do. I thought that after three weeks it would get easier but it is not getting easier. I have no side effects at all from any of the drugs only the disturbance of sleep. Some of them were written on them that if you would stop them suddenly you would risk getting seizures but nothing happened thankfully. I am not even depressed or sad I am just irritated and sad about the sleeping problem."," Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. The main reason of your problem could be due to anxiety. You can try some relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation exercises, deep breathing exercise etc. These will help you to reduce stress and tension and improve your sleep. You should avoid caffeine containing products as these may interfere with your sleep. You can try some relaxation techniques before going to bed. You can try some light yoga exercises like jalandhar bandha and shavasan which will help you to reduce stress and improve your sleep quality.

440,"Hi doctor,Yesterday I had to have a frenuloplasty. I had to have a general anaesthetic. I woke up and never got any advice off the urologist because I never saw him after the procedure. The nurse who discharged me told me to take off the dressing in the morning and wash the wound and the foreskin twice daily. My concern is today I noticed my foreskin has become swollen and looks similar to a balloon. The stitches are preventing me from pulling my foreskin back over the glans.

My glans is very sensitive. So, it feels like an electric shock every time I move."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The swelling may be due to post-operative inflammation.  It will subside gradually with time.  You can try to pull your foreskin back gently over the glans.  But if there is pain while doing so then don't force it.

445,"Hello doctor,I have personal dermatitis. I was prescribed 12 weeks of 100 mg Doxycycline. However, I am skeptical about taking antibiotics as I have read that with a lot of people the rash returns upon finishing treatment. Also, it can mess up your gut which is apparently linked to perioral dermatitis. I have gone gluten, dairy and sugar free, started Probiotics, Zinc and Omega 3 supplements and the rash still persists. I also use Metro gel and also it helps my rash is still there. It is mild but is very annoying and sore. If I take antibiotics will it make things worse? Or should I go get allergy testing? I have also cut out flouride toothpaste and eliminated SLS.",1. Cutting out foods from diet may not be enough to cure perioral dermatitis. You need to know what caused it in first place.2. Antibiotics may not cause relapse if taken for short duration like 5-7 days.3. Allergy testing will help find possible causes of perioral dermatitis. It will give you idea about what needs to be avoided in future.4. You should try to avoid stress and anxiety as much as possible. Stress and anxiety may trigger acne or worsen existing one.

447,"im a 14 year old child . My concern is that i only have 24 set of teeth , 1 is growing at the back but i only have 13 baby teeth and 11 are permanent teeth . To be add on , i have doubling rows since three years back, and have gotten it out last year but it is still hasnt come back to its place because of the lack of space . My teeth are a mess , i want to get braces but i have so many baby teeth . I dont know what to do please help me","lcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns... Braces are needed if there is a misalignment of teeth or bite problem. In your case, the dentist will first take an x-ray to see how much space is available for the eruption of the permanent teeth. The dentist might need to extract some permanent teeth in order to make room for the other permanent teeth to erupt. In such cases, the extraction is done after the wisdom tooth erupts as the wisdom tooth erupts from the roof of the mouth (maxilla) while the other teeth erupt from the jaw bone (mandible). You can discuss with your dentist regarding this. Hope you found the advice useful. Regards."

449,"Hello doctor,1. Why we are getting frequent colds?2. What can be done to reduce the amount of colds we are getting?","3. Can you suggest any medication which will help in reducing the frequency of colds?1. I am sorry to say that there is no way to prevent or cure colds completely. Colds are caused by viruses and they have their own innate immunity to fight against them and therefore, antibiotics do not work for them. The best thing one can do is to avoid exposing oneself to cold and other irritants like smokes and dusts. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water and clean your face also. Use handkerchief while sneezing and coughing instead of hands so as to avoid spreading the virus. Take plenty of fluids, eat healthy diet and take multivitamin supplements daily.

You can apply OTC analgesic gel over the affected area. Hope this helps."

This could cause pain, jaundice etc.4) It is better to consult a surgeon for removal of the gall bladder at this stage."

464,"Hello doctor,I am having back pain. Six months ago I had S1 and L5 fusion. Normally, no surgery or anything. My doctor asked me to take rest. Then two months back I was again having pain in my back and no findings from my X-ray. Then I did an MRI four days back when I was having pain in my legs mainly in the thigh, calf, and foot. The pain is continuous. It is not resting for a minute, but the amount of pain varies sometimes a lot sometimes a little.I am 25 years old male. I was so active with all the sports activity and all, for last one year. After I bought my bike I stopped playing most of the sports, also the walking came down to below average because of the bike. Does the less walking have something to do with all that I am suffering? I had two to three accidents with my bike, but none of them were serious ones. I mean I did not get hurt badly. Just some scratches on my hand. So I am confused if the condition is done from a trauma. The doctors asked me to take one month rest and physiotherapy at this moment. Please suggest me what to do, I am really worried if it is sciatica or something even greater. I only want to heal the issue, recover from it completely even if that takes me one year or two."," Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your history and would like to make suggestions as follows:1) Please follow up with your doctor to discuss the results of your MRI scan.2) Since you have undergone S1 & L5 fusion, you should be able to walk normally which you are unable to do.3) It could be due to nerve compression in the spine causing symptoms of pain radiating to lower limb.4) For this you need to consult a Neurosurgeon who will give further investigations.5) You may need to go for nerve conduction studies and EMG to rule out any neurological deficit.6) In addition, you can do physiotherapy to strengthen your muscles around the spinal cord.7) Also, I would recommend you to use a lumbar corset to avoid strain on the spine while sitting.8) Avoid"

466,"Hi doctor,I am a 27 year old male. I masturbate twice a week. Recently, during masturbation, I felt some pain on the back side of my neck and head. Please help.","1.

This can happen after intense physical activity or a long day at work. It usually resolves by itself over time.2. In case it doesn't resolve, then you need to visit an orthopedic surgeon for a clinical assessment.3. In the meantime you can use anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen (Advil) for relief.4. If the pain persists, you may need to see an orthopedist for further evaluation and management. Hope this helps."
467,"Hi doctor,I have insomnia for a couple of weeks. These weeks are being the worst where I have sleepless nights. Last night, I took Trazadone 150 mg which was prescribed and slept. Then again after that, I went back to Trazadone 100 mg tonight along with Melatonin, but I did not get any sleep. Is there anything I can do tonight to get some sleep? How long does insomnia typically last? Am I at risk for anything fatal? Also, I am planning to go back to my GP later on."," The duration of insomnia depends upon the cause. In your case, it is due to anxiety. It usually takes several weeks to months to recover from insomnia. You may need to take medicines like benzodiazepines or trazodone for few weeks. But if symptoms persist for more than one month, then it needs further evaluation. Try to avoid caffeine in the evening. Avoid stress and tension. Practice relaxation exercises like deep breathing before going to bed. Take small break during daytime and try to sleep early."
468,"Hi,I had unprotected intercourse with my partner a month back. I did not ejaculate inside her. Later to be sure, she did a home pregnancy test after 21 days, it came negative. Since yesterday, she is having vomiting sensation, not able to eat anything, light stomach cramps and light fever. She did pregnancy test today morning again; it came negative. We are confused and worried if she is pregnant. She has PCOD also. She had her last periods 45 days back. Do we have to go for a blood test?","100% of women who get pregnant will experience some symptoms that can include nausea/vomiting, fatigue, sore breasts etc. The only way to know for sure if your wife is pregnant or not is by going to a lab and getting a blood test done. The blood test should show up whether or not there is any hormone in her body to indicate that she is pregnant (or not). It would be best to wait until at least day 6-7 of her cycle before doing any testing. This is because when the egg is released from the ovary, progesterone levels rise quickly which can cause many of these symptoms. Hope this helps!"

I have hereditary low blood pressure so that the side effect was not an issue for me. However, after a few days of use, the licorice causes me to develop muscle aches all over my body. Which I assume are due to the reduced potassium levels from the licorice. Is there a better alternative to the licorice? Or a way to prevent the loss of potassium so I can use it for more than a few days at a time? No matter what I ate, (bananas, avocados, apricots), it did not seem to be enough.","1) Licorice is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure and kidney disease as it may cause hypokalemia.2) It also has estrogenic activity which may lead to fluid retention in some people.3) You should avoid taking licorice for prolonged periods of time because it affects your potassium levels.4) Avoid taking licorice if you have high blood pressure or heart problems.5) There are many other natural options like ginseng, ashwagandha, saw palmetto etc. that can help improve your sex drive naturally without causing any side effects.6) You can try out these natural alternatives but before doing so consult an Ayurveda specialist who will guide you properly."

485,"Hello doctor,I am a 44-year-old male with a BMI of 26. During a recent health checkup of blood and urine, the following readings were observed. I have mentioned only the ones who have the higher readings. Protein 1+ detected in dipstick, serum uric acid at 9.2 mg/dL, MPV at 12.5 fL, FBS at 112 mg/dL, HbA1c at 5.5, cholesterol at 227 mg/dL, triglycerides at 181 mg/dL, VLDL is at 36.2 mg/dL, ALT/SGPT at 48 U/L. Serum creatinine at 1.23, increased from 0.99 tested six months back. Other than this, all others were normal. I also have been infected with hepatitis B twice and vaccinated for hepatitis B. I have been a diabetic for more than two years. The HbA1c vary between 5.5 and 6.5. The first one was done two years ago. I also have hypertension for more than five years. It is not very much under control. It varies from 135/80 to 150/100 and now it has reduced a bit to 140/90. I met my general physician who advised me to check my albumin to creatinine ratio. I tested it four times. The results are as follows:  55 ug/mg, 150 mg/g, 11.4 ug/mg, 37.5 mg/g. My ultrasonogram revealed fatty liver and cystitis. All the rest is fine. My ECG was fine.

I am not able to understand why my albumin levels are so high and I would like to know how and when can they be rectified. I have attached reports for your further reference."," Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I am very sorry to hear about your problem. You should get examined by a specialist to find out if there is any other cause for high proteinuria. Since you have had hepatitis B infection earlier, it may be possible that the kidneys may be affected due to this. For this, you need to get an ultrasound scan of abdomen done to rule out any other cause. Meanwhile, you should take plenty of fluids, avoid excess salt intake and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Wishing you good health. Thank you."
486,"Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern regarding your sons health problem. There is no need to worry about this issue. The epidermal nevus is benign condition which occurs due to abnormal pigmentation of the skin. It doesn't spread anywhere else in the body, and it won't cause any harmful effects. Epidermal nevi don't usually cause problems unless they change color, size or shape. But if you are worried about it then you can see a dermatologist and get evaluated. Hope you find this answer helpful. Wishing you good health. Take care."
487,"Hello doctor,Every night around 2-3 AM, any thought that crosses my mind makes me overthink about it. I am worried about such things that do not have a fixed solution. It may or may not happen. I\ve tried listening to meditating sounds, calming sound during that time but to no avail. After an hour or two I do get normal but then I am so full of energy that I cannot fall asleep so I get up and start some work. (I am a freelancer working from home).I usually cannot sleep until my head feels heavy, eyes start closing and I start dozing off while working. For a few weeks, I have been sleeping in the afternoon or evening for three to five hours only. Rest of the time I am either thinking or working. Sometimes if I cannot stop thinking I smoke around two to three cigarettes to get over it. It does not help me sleep but helps me focus on work more and overthinking stops quite instantly.","1) You need to learn how to relax your body and mind. Meditation is one way but there are other techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation etc. which can be learned from a qualified therapist.2) Try to identify what are these thoughts that keep recurring? Are they related to past actions/events or future possibilities or something else? Once you know this, you can try to find ways to deal with them.3) Avoid smoking - it will only add to your problems.4) Be physically active - this will also reduce stress levels.5) Get enough restful sleep at night and avoid staying awake late into night.6) Exercise regularly and eat healthy food.7) Keep yourself busy throughout the day with productive activities. Hope this answers your query."

She does not complain of pain anywhere else. There is no pain inside the urethra, no burning sensation while urinating and the discharge is whitish-yellowish and watery. She does not have any sign of fever. She bought labia herpes cream yesterday. After application it changed the color today to darker yellow and some of it fell off. What could this be?","1) The symptoms that your sister has described do not point towards genital herpes. However, she did have sexual intercourse prior to the symptoms developing which increases the risk of acquiring the infection.2) The symptoms that she has mentioned can also be due to bacterial vaginosis (bacterial imbalance in the vagina). This can cause itching, burning sensation during urination and light colored discharge.3) Herpes infection usually causes blisters over the genitals. However, if there are no such lesions then the diagnosis should be ruled out.4) If the symptoms persist for more than a week or increase in severity despite taking treatment, then she should get examined by a gynecologist.5) I would suggest that she takes antibiotics like Augmenting along with metronidazole tablets three times daily for seven days.6)"
489,"Hello doctor,I have been suffering from breathing issues for about two months. At that time, I was coming off Duloxetine HCl. I was also having weird headaches, but that has subsided. I have been to several doctors and had blood work, oxygen level test and pulmonary test. Everything came back normal. With my breathing, I have the constant urge to take a deep breath in hopes of getting that satisfying deep sigh. I am constantly thinking about my breathing, even when I sleep. I am still able to exercise vigorously, run long distances, etc., with no problems. My fear is that I am experiencing diaphragm weakness as a result of something neurological. Here are my questions. I have been placed on anxiety medicines, which have helped to keep me sane. What is your expert opinion? Does this sound like diaphragm weakness? Would I be able to exercise vigorously if my breathing muscles were weakening?",1. The symptoms you describe suggest an organic cause for the problem rather than psychological one as you have ruled out by all tests.2. I would recommend that you consult a physician who can examine you and then refer you to a pulmonologist or respiratory specialist.3. There may be a variety of causes for such symptoms. It could be simple asthma or bronchitis.4. You should get yourself examined by a physician first and then referred for further investigations.5. You need a thorough evaluation to determine the exact cause.

If you have mild symptoms then lifestyle modifications like weight reduction, healthy diet, regular physical activity will suffice. In moderate cases medications like aspirin, clopidogrel etc. can be administered. For severe cases like yours, surgical revascularization procedures like stenting or bypass is needed. So if you feel that your symptoms are not improving despite lifestyle changes then you should definitely consult a cardiologist and get evaluated. Hope this helps."

She landed on some workout equipment, which hurt her stomach at a 45o angle at the mid bottom section. She is still in pain, and now she has a bleeding with a discharge of mucus-like blood chunks. She has never bled before with our first child, and I am in need of some immediate guidance.","1st Trimester of pregnancy is from conception to 12 weeks. You have described that your wife had fall during this period. It may be due to abrasion of uterine wall or injury to cervix. Since there is no bleeding in between, it seems to be related to trauma. Please consult gynecologist for clinical examination and ultrasonography so that exact cause can be diagnosed and appropriate treatment can be given."

497,"Hi doctor,I have a problem with a frequent cough, cold, fatigue, etc. I started taking Chyawanprash and Maha Sudarshana churna in the morning and Chyawanprash and Triphala powder at night. After 1 month of usage, I feel quite better. Further, I also have fatigue, insomnia, and stress. So, I am planning to include Ashwagandha and Brahmi also in my daily intake. Can you please suggest if I can take Chyawanprash, Maha Sudarshana churna, Triphala, Ashwagandha and Brahmi every day?","1) Yes, you can take all these herbs together as they are safe and not known to cause adverse effects when taken together.2) You should also try to find out the reason for your chronic cough, cold, fatigue and insomnia.

My bpm from rest to stand increases by at least 30 points but averages a 50 point increase. My resting bpm is 40, and upon standing it increases to 90 and peaks up to 110.I had done an echo cardiogram and EKG. I feel light-headed upon standing, along with sudden pulsation, headache and muscle spasms. I feel blackout, syncope, and fainting. I had spontaneous jolt, breathless, palpitations, flutters, fatigue, chills and skin rash on the back of hands.My mental disturbances include confusion, inability to maintain thoughts. I also feel pointless random irritability, ankle pain, random lapse of balance, throbbing extremities, vibrating vision, burning sensation, social anxiety, depression, irritating bowl movements, no appetite and chest discomfort.I wast told to mention the possibility of autonomic dysfunction as its often times overlooked."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. You have mentioned that your heart rate increases significantly when you stand up after sitting down. This is called orthostatic hypotension or postural hypotension. It occurs because blood vessels dilate while you are lying down and constrict when you stand up leading to low blood pressure. There may be other causes like anemia, thyroid problems etc. which can cause similar symptoms. You need to get evaluated properly to know what is causing this problem. You should wear a monitor which records your heart rhythm continuously for 24 hours. This will help us find out if there is any abnormality in your heart rhythm."
499,"Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you describe, all your reports are within normal range except LDL. The problem with LDL is that most people do not know their level until they take a test. Even if your LDL level is slightly higher than what is considered normal, it does not mean that you will get heart attack or stroke. You should discuss with your cardiologist about the need for medications to reduce your cholesterol levels. Regarding your symptoms, I would suggest taking medication such as pregabalin or gabapentin which can give relief from pain. If these medicines fail to relieve your symptoms, you may require further investigations including angiography. Hope this helps. Take care."

I would like to know if your mother had any other associated problems like heart failure or anemia or any other renal problem. If there is no such thing then reducing creatinine is possible by reducing insulin intake. However, it may take some time as it takes a long time for the body to adjust to changes in insulin requirement. It is also necessary to reduce fluid intake and increase water intake. Also, medicines which are not taken regularly should be stopped. The medications should be taken according to need. As far as hemoglobin is concerned, it can be raised by increasing iron intake. You may discuss this with your physician."

The results of these tests will help me to exclude the possible causes of your symptoms and then to prescribe you appropriate treatment. Please do not hesitate to ask if something is not clear.

My front tooth appears green, and they are deeply separated. Is there any way available to save my tooth?","1) Yes, you can save your teeth by getting root canal treatment done for them.2) For the green coloration - it is mostly due to accumulation of debris/plaque inside the tooth which has caused secondary caries (decay).3) Green stains are not so easily removed as compared to white ones.4) You should go for Root Canal Treatment first and then get your teeth cleaned.5) After completing both the procedures, you will be able to keep your teeth healthy."

I need you to explain these results to me."," Hi, dear, thanks for your question. I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Azoospermia means there is no sperms in the semen. In your case, we can see that both FSH levels and LH levels are normal which indicates that there is no problem with pituitary gland.

515,"Hello doctor,My 4 years old daughter has an inward turn in her right eye after concentrating for a while. We had an eye test recently. Can you tell me if her results mean she needs glasses as she keeps saying her eyes hurt watching television and readings of her results are: Right eye sph +1.50 cyl -0.50, left eye sph +1.50 cyl -0.50. They told me she is long sighted and we have a strong family history of squints and glasses. I do not know if I should get a second opinion.","1. Long-sightedness (hyperopia) means that light focuses behind your eye, instead of on it. This causes objects to appear blurred unless they are very close to your face.2. Short-sightedness (myopia) means that light focuses in front of your eye, instead of on it. This causes distant objects to appear blurred.3. Astigmatism is when the shape of the cornea or lens of your eye is irregular, causing light to be focused at two points rather than one point. This causes objects to look blurry at all distances.4. Eye strain can cause headaches, tiredness, and other symptoms. These symptoms usually improve with resting your eyes.5. In my opinion your child need to wear glasses for both the eyes. But you can take second opinion from another opthalmologist before taking any action."

You may take anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen for pain relief. Hope this helps. Take care."
517,"Hello doctor,My period was delayed. I had a pregnancy check which was positive. I consulted a gynecologist since I did not want a baby and hence decided to go for medical abortion (as my son is just 12 months). She prescribed me with medicine and after 48 hours she had asked me to place 4 medicines in my genitals before going to bed. My menstrual cycle started the very next morning and continued for 3 days. After 15 days, she had called me for an ultrasound to examine whether all was done perfectly. I had an ultrasound scan (reports attached).The doctor said that it has not come out completely and therefore prescribed medicine (prescription attached). She gave me two medicines to place in my genitals. Next morning, I had very less bleeding which gradually stopped at night. Doctor, I am very much confused as to what is happening. In no case, I want a medical abortion. Please suggest as to what should I do so that all gets fine.","99% of abortions are successful if the procedure is done within 6 weeks from conception. The failure rate increases beyond that time. After 7-8 weeks, the fetus may be too large for successful removal by the procedure. Therefore, it is important that you have the abortion as soon as possible. You can take misoprostol tablets orally 100 mcg every 3 hours for up to 4 doses. This is taken in combination with mifepristone 600 mcg by mouth. This causes contractions and expulsion of products of conception. In some cases, surgical evacuation of the uterine contents may be necessary. If there is heavy bleeding, you will need to be hospitalized. This type of abortion is safe and effective."

520,"Hello doctor,I have high eye pressure of 30 and 24, visual field loss, and at times I go completely blind in both eyes. I have also gone blind in just one eye. I just went back to the eye doctor when I had the pressure of 24 and 30. I have been there three times and each time I had a high eye pressure. He at first told me everything looked good until I asked him what my pressure was again because he specifically said my pressure was good when I knew that it was high. He told me that it was fairly high when I asked for it but he says I do not have any optic nerve damage and that it is highly unlikely that I have glaucoma because I am 23 years old. But my research has told me differently that high eye pressure alone does not mean that that you have glaucoma but if you have visual field loss or optic nerve damage with your high eye pressure then you do. So I do not know what is going on? Can you please help me understand and is it possible that I do have glaucoma and should go to another doctor?","1) It seems from your history that your eye pressure is always high. In such case you must be under treatment.2) Glaucoma is diagnosed by finding optic disc changes like cupping, pallor etc., and visual field defect.3) You may get these tests done so that we can come to conclusion whether you have glaucoma or not."

And now he did not poop for the past two days and trying very hard and cries in between feeds by trying to poop. Is this an effect of enzymes? Please help.","1. I think your kid is having some bowel problem and so he is passing more gas than normal.2. You can try adding some probiotics like Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces Boulardii to your diet for 5-7 days3. You should also try reducing the amount of milk you give your kid at one go.4. Also, do not feed your child immediately after feeding because it will cause excessive gas formation.5. Keep your baby upright for about 2 hours after feeding.6.

524,"Hello doctor,I am a 62-year-old male. I went for a routine X-ray, and the radiologist found some streakiness in the lower left lung. He said it appeared small and not significant, but it was adviced that I should come back in six months for a comparative X-ray and that it could just be a scar from an earlier infection.I have read that a small scar area is probably non-progressive but I have also read about IPF, and that fills me with fear. Spirometry test was normal as it was a physical exam. I am so scared that it might be a progressive disease, but I hope that it is just an old scar as it is really small. Otherwise mostly healthy with no cough or difficulty breathing at all. Are all lung scars progressive?","1) Yes, all scars are potentially progressive. However, there are many different types of scarring and they don't all behave the same way. The most common type of scar seen in lungs (and other organs) is called fibrosis. This is when the body repairs itself by forming collagen, which forms dense tissue. Fibrotic scars can be very bad if they form too much collagen, however this doesn't happen in most cases.2) Your doctor was correct to say that this was likely due to an old infection. Infections can cause some degree of scarring, and these are usually reversible.3) It is possible that your scarring is related to IPF, but this would require further testing such as CT scan or bronchoscopy to rule out other causes. You will need to see your doctor again for a repeat chest x-ray and possibly a pulmonary function test."

536,"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I had my kidney stone removed a year ago for causing mild hydronephrosis at my right kidney. During the treatment, I was exposed to full of radiation, abdominal CT scan, lithotripsy, fluoroscopy, and another fluoroscopy during stent insertion. I am not sure how the doctor manages the radiation. I did my treatment abroad and it is not really a well-developed country. He might not even care bout it. I studied some about radiation when I was in dental school so I am very scared of the side effects.So if I am to have another case of hydronephrosis, should I just remove the kidney rather than undergoing such radiation which may cause me high risk of future cancer? Because as you can see, I am still so young and I just started my career. What do you suggest? Do the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa?

And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.",1) The chances of developing cancer after exposure to radiation are low (<10%) but the possibility cannot be completely ruled out.2) The prognosis of cancer after exposure to radiation is usually good if detected early.3) There is no other less risky treatment option except surgery.4) Invasive treatments like ureteric stents carry a higher risk of infection and slow healing.5) You can discuss with your doctor before any further treatment regarding kidney stones.

558,"Hello doctor,I am a 19-year-old male. I have been to a few ophthalmologists about this and they seem to think it is benign. But I want to get some other input on this. If I widen my eyes and move my head around, I can see shadows in my far peripheral vision moving as my head does. And it seems that the shadows change and become different sizes as time goes on.Now I do have astigmatism in my right eye and from time to time I get aching, almost gnawing pains that are with the movement of the eye. And has happened in both at the same time before. I find that it happens mostly when I am in a place with very weird or bright lighting or when I am looking at a bright screen in a weirdly lit room.I suffer from anxiety and depression which is why I guess I am coming out to ask some more questions. And I also have Asperger's syndrome. The aches radiate to my temple as well. But as I have said I have been to doctors and they have dilated my pupils and looked at my retina and ocular nerves and told me they looked good. So I honestly do not know what could be causing these weird shadows. I have had them for quite a while. And they also get bigger and more noticeable with head tilt like when I exercise or go running or do something very physical.I currently take Prozac 20 mg and Pantoprazole 10 mg."," Hi, Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query. In my opinion you should consult an Ophthalmologist again. As you have astigmatism, you may need to wear spectacles regularly.

562,"Hello doctor,Does Methamphetamine interfere with local anesthesia? My friend was told she would not have to stop Adderall before surgery. I know that is not the same, but is there anything particularly dangerous about methamphetamine and local anesthesia? What about Phentermine?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. I am not aware of any such interaction between methamphetamines and local anesthetics. Phentermine is used as appetite suppressant and is safe when taken under medical supervision. It does not interact with local anesthetics and hence no need to worry about it. Hope this information helps."
563,"Hello doctor,Can you please suggest any good skin lightening cream not such that like magical whitening but I meant for healthy skin and color does not matter that much. I have heard about the Golite cream. How is it? Can it be used like other fairness creams? I want to use, Clin shine cream which is newly available in the market. Please suggest me.","1) There is no such thing as a ""good"" skin lightening cream. Creams containing hydroquinone or mercury are contraindicated for use by pregnant women because they can cause birth defects.2) The safest way to lighten your skin without causing further damage is to stay out of the sun. Wear clothing that covers most of your body, including a hat and sunglasses.3) Use a broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day. Reapply frequently, especially if you are sweating or swimming.4) Apply a vitamin C serum to your face twice a day.5) If you must use a skin-lightening cream, look for one that contains kojic acid, licorice extract, soybean extract, or comic acid instead of hydroquinone or mercury.6"

Most of the medication that helps with erection including UpHold, Caverta, Pengra with and without the combination of depressant like Prodep 10 or 20 mg (without any sign of depression) have not helped me.

Your question is interesting and important. I think your problem can be solved by a few steps. First, you should know that the majority of men with erection problems have a good sexual response when they are in a relaxed atmosphere, such as when having sex with their partner. So, try to have sex with your wife in a more romantic atmosphere, with less stress. Secondly, you need to know that there are many types of impotence, so it is necessary to evaluate the type of impotence. For example, some people may have difficulty getting an erection but can maintain it for a long time; others might get erections easily but lose them quickly. Thirdly, you should avoid alcohol and smoking. Alcohol has been shown to reduce erection quality and frequency. Smoking also reduces blood flow to the genital area and thus affects erection quality.

I have a few doubts:Are HIV 1 and 2 with p24 duo test after 28 days window period conclusive? My result is nonreactive.I got a positive result for rubella. CMV and HSV 1 and 2 IgG positive but IgM negative. Am I an eligible person for marriage and sexual relationship?What is the treatment plan for those TORCH IgG positive results?Of note, I had unprotected oral sex twice and protected vaginal sex three times in the last two months.","1) Yes, the p24 antigen test can be used to detect HIV infection. It is not as accurate as the ELISA tests which measure the antibodies against HIV but it is still helpful. The window period of the p24 antigen test is 6 weeks.2) Rubella is usually mild and self limiting illness. However, if you are pregnant, then you need to take prophylactic medication to prevent fetal congenital anomalies.3) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is also a common viral infection and most individuals will clear the virus from their body without any complications.4) Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are both very common viruses that cause cold sores.5) No, there is no treatment for these conditions"

568,"Hi doctor,I had toothache for the past 48 hours. It made the right side of my face to completely swell. The toothache has now gone, but the swelling is increasing and started affecting the eye area. I have applied heat and ice to the swollen area, but neither have worked. Please give me some advice to quickly reduce the swelling as I have an important event later today. Thank you."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you have toothache, it could be due to infection in the tooth, or gum problem. First get your teeth examined by a dentist, if it is found to be infected, then go for root canal treatment. If there is no infection, then go for scaling and polishing. This will remove the deposits from the teeth and gums and prevent further infection. You can also apply warm saline compresses over the affected area. Do cool compresses while travelling. Hope this helps you. Wish you good health. Take care."

She seems to be having retractions at night between 10 PM and 2 AM like clockwork. They are not severe as her respiration rate is 22-28, pulse oximeter reading is 96-98%. Pulse is elevated at times due to Albuterol and the highest recorded is 160 with no fever. She is tired and is pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes.I followed up with the pediatrician yesterday and he diagnosed her with an ear infection and put her on Augmentin. He listened to her lungs and said they sounded fine. She had an Albuterol breathing treatment about one hour prior to her visit. These symptoms that comes on night are scary. Productive cough and the sound of occasional constriction in the throat causing a gag, with these mild subcostal retractions.It is hard for me to determine do we go to the ER or not?

The best way to prevent any unwanted pregnancy is to use regular birth control. It will be better for your mental health if you do not rely on emergency contraception as a regular form of birth control. In terms of getting pregnant, it varies from woman to woman.

Kindly look into it.",1) Wounds usually heal within 3-4 weeks after surgery unless there is infection or other complications.2) You may be having some kind of infection which is causing the slow healing. You should consult your surgeon again & get examined by him/her.3) If it is infection then you will require antibiotics along with steroids.4) If it is due to some other reason then you may require another surgical procedure.5) You may also require a skin graft if the wound does not heal even after taking antibiotics.6) Smoking and alcohol consumption may delay the healing of wounds so avoid them as much as possible.7) You may apply some moisturizers like petroleum jelly over the wound to improve the healing.8) Take care...!

When I was pregnant, there was no bleeding but had spotting throughout. Since delivery I am suffering again with irregular and heavy bleeds. It became worse for the past eight months. I have IBS which is stress related. I am taking Adalat for high blood pressure, which is under control.

There are no fibroids or polyps or other pelvic masses or free fluid. Then what is it?",1) I would suggest that you do not take mefenamic acid and tranexamic acid. These medicines can cause blood clotting problems. They should be avoided.2) You need to get an evaluation from an endocrinologist who will order blood work that includes thyroid and prolactin levels.3) Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) does involve hormonal imbalance and can result in irregular cycles.4) Adenomyosis involves growth of the lining of the uterus into the muscle wall.5) Anteversion means the uterine cavity is facing upward instead of downward.6) Bulk of this information has been obtained from your ultrasound examination.7) I recommend seeing an endocrinologist who can help with treatment options.

She has been experiencing fast breathing, difficulty in feeding, failure to thrive, clubbed fingers but the cardiologist told me they will not be in a rush to fix the problem. I cannot stand what she is going through. What is her survival rate? Can I have the problem solved early? Of note, she is currently on Lasix and Aldactone.","1) The Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that occurs when there is an obstruction to blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. This causes oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood, which can cause cyanosis (blue color of skin).2) The survival rates for this condition are very good. The majority of patients who undergo surgery at 6 months of age or earlier, will have a normal life expectancy.3) In your case, since she is already one year old, it might be too late for surgical correction. However, she should still continue taking medication prescribed by her doctor. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."

598,"Hello doctor,I am suspicious of lymphoma. In the summer, I had an itchy rash on my neck, it went away, came back, and now went again. I have bilateral hip and bone pain. I have night sweats two to three times weekly. I had a low-grade fever right before my period and will go away. No palpable or noticeable lymph nodes except in thigh about an inch away from the groin. I have had CBC's and sed rates completed at least five times in two months. I took a chest x-ray, head and abdomen CT scan, and pelvic ultrasound. I consulted an ENT who looked down the throat with a scope, and everything is negative, so doctors will not pursue lymphoma any further. Do you think with everything so far, should I still be investigating lymphoma?I am currently on Lisinopril 20 mg.",1) Your symptoms are suggestive of lymphoma but all your tests are negative. You need to get a FNAC done of that lump which is in the groin area. The treatment for this depends upon the type of lymphoma. A biopsy would help us to know what type of lymphocytes are present in the tissue and then we can treat accordingly.2) The other possibility is that it could be reactive hyperplasia. Please visit a good surgeon and get a FNAC done of that lump.

He was put on a nebulizer and after three days his condition has improved. So, the doctor suggested moving from the nebulizer to Asthalin huf puf. Later that night, he had a continuous cough for one hour and was then back on nebulizer. He is put on oxygen support as his SpO2 dropped to around 86.

I am sorry to hear about your child. Bronchitis usually occurs due to viral infections of respiratory tract. It can be caused by bacterial infections also. But in most cases, it is viral. The symptoms like fever and cough will come down spontaneously within 7-10 days. The asthma medications will help him to breathe better. Continuous coughing can be because of post infectious wheezing or reactive airways disease. The best treatment for it is inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). You may need to consult a pediatrician who will advise you accordingly. Hope this helps you. Wishing your child good health. Best regards."
600,"Hi doctor,I was on a business trip and my friend and I went to a high-end brothel. My friend hired two girls and brought them back to the hotel. He had to take a phone call and while the girls were waiting for him they performed oral sex on me for a few minutes without a condom. They had no symptoms in their lips and facial region. I am worried, I contracted herpes. I got tested for chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis, and HIV and they came up negative. It has been four weeks since the incindent and I have no herpes symtomps. What are my chances of having herpes? I know people might not show symptoms.

I appreciate all your help with my concerns."," Hi there, Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor. If you have never had any symptoms of genital herpes before then your risk of developing it is quite low (0-1%). You should be happy that you did not get infected by these girls as it would have caused much more problems if you get infected now. But it looks like you have taken care of yourself well. The most important thing is that you do not develop any symptoms of genital herpes soon. If you do, kindly consult an Infectious Disease specialist who can diagnose this condition through a simple blood test and prescribe antivirals which will prevent further complications.

601,"Hello doctor,How accurate are skin prick tests for predicting positive reactions? My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Skin prick test can be very helpful in diagnosis of allergy. It is positive if there is redness at least 10 mm within 20 minutes after testing. It should be done by an expert dermatologist or immunologist as they know how to interpret them. You may need to repeat once or twice to get correct result. But generally they are very reliable in prediction of allergies. Hope this answers your question."

Frenectomy is a surgical procedure for treating gum problems. In this procedure, the gingival tissues covering the jaw bone are cut and sutured together with the help of stitches.

633,"Hello doctor,I have crooked teeth at front and tooth behind the crooked teeth was decayed and half broke in sideways. It was touching the crooked teeth in backward and my teeth in under jaws are somewhat misaligned. Do I need a tooth extraction for braces?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I am Chat Doctor.  Your problem is not so simple to be solved with a single treatment. The first thing that must be done is an orthopedic evaluation of your whole mouth which includes a study of how your jaw joints are functioning. This will determine if there is a functional cause of your malocclusion (bad bite) and if it can be corrected by changing the position or orientation of your teeth. If this is determined to be possible than orthodontic treatment may be started.  In the meantime, some orthopedic appliances such as a Twin Block or Herbst may be used to guide the growth pattern of your jaw and head.  If the functional cause cannot be determined then you will need to consider other treatment options.  Hope you got my reply.  Wishing you good health. Regards"

Thanks for your query! It seems that you have an abscessed tooth or gum infection. You should get it checked by a dentist and get a thorough clinical evaluation done.

636,"Hello doctor,My baby is one year old. She has soft teeth in the front and she is not able to bite anything with the upper teeth. If she bites, the teeth start chipping. What am I to do?"," Hi dear, This is because of the lack of strength in the jaw muscles which is called as TMJ dysfunction. The TMJ or temporomandibular joint is the connection between the lower jaw and the skull. It helps in opening and closing of the mouth. When there is any problem like- injury, arthritis, muscle spasm etc., it leads to pain and difficulty in opening and closing the mouth. For this, you can consult an orthodontist who will give you exercises for the muscles of the jaws. Also, a physiotherapist can help you out by giving you some physical therapy. Hope that answers your query. Thanks"
637,"Hello doctor,I am 32 years old. I was using self-tanning creams around seven years all year long. I have stopped for the last two years. I am worried because I have read that self-tanning creams are causing cancer and tumors. Is it true? Are they out of my system or will it take years to appear if they caused me cancer?","1. Self tanning products do not cause cancer. In fact, no known carcinogen has been linked to self tan products.2. The only way to know for sure is by having your blood tested for levels of DHA (the active ingredient in most self tan products).3. It can be done at any time but would need to be monitored as you continue to use self tan products.4. You may wish to consult with your dermatologist about this."

I started using Hexidine mouthwash last month for whitening of teeth, but it is not helping me, and soon my teeth are becoming brownish at some places.

Avoid the use of any abrasive toothpaste for brushing. Maintain proper oral hygiene by brushing twice daily and flossing in between the teeth. Use of mouth wash once daily will help prevent gum problems. Thanks."
641,"Hello doctor,I had suffered from common cold symptoms three months back. It resolved completely in about 18 to 19 days. Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature (by touching only) and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started. But the medicine did not work. However, previously whenever I experienced a runny nose and constant sneezing, one Cetirizine tablet helped.In fact, it resolved the problem. Could you please share your opinion on this, please, why the cetirizine did not work? Secondly, I may have had (but I am not sure at all) a possible HIV exposure around 10 months ago. I did not get tested. I have consulted few doctors online who said that the chances of HIV infection is quite less. Assuming I may have HIV, could it be the reason why the cetirizine did not work? I wish to mention here that I had high blood pressure for which I take medicines and last month when I checked, it was under control."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe you had cold and cough for 3 months and now got similar symptoms. In the first case Cetirizine worked well, but in second case it didn't work. The cause of these symptoms can be many like viral infection, allergy etc. You should visit a physician and get yourself examined and investigated. Get a nasopharyngoscopy done. For cold, you can use decongestants and antihistamines. Take care."

A year later, my WBC decreased to 4 and since then has continued to decrease but now I have a low granulocyte count of 1.7 which I have not had before. It is now 3.5 from recent CBC. My last draw was a year ago and it was 4.0. I have been as low as 3.6 in the past. I am a highly stressed person since after the birth of my son. I have been in school for my BSN and MSN and I am wondering this could be related to stress. My H+H is within normal limits with only a slight decrease in my HCT of 28.1.

I can understand your concern and would like to reassure you that there are some simple tests which will help us understand what is happening to your body and why you are having such problems.2. Please get an ECG done as well as a thyroid function test (TSH, FT4) to start with. This should tell us whether there is any heart or thyroid problem causing the lowered white cells.3.

646,"Hello doctor,I am having ""mood disorder"" and under treatment for around nine years. The doctor said that the medicines are to be taken lifelong. Now prescribed Valporil CR-300 and LithoSun SR tablets (both 1-0-1). If I come to Ayurveda, can I stop these medicines within some time? While visiting an astrologist, he recommended me to take ""Manasamitra vatakam"" tablets along with Saraswata Ghritam for 21 days. My query is, can the above Ayurveda tablet be used along with the other allopathic medicines? Will there be any side effects? In what proportion is it to be used?","1. Mental health issues require long term management as they are chronic conditions, in which symptoms may recur or worsen over time.2. Medications like lithium, valproate etc. are usually required lifelong, but if you do not want to continue them then consult your psychiatrist regarding the same.3. Manasamitra vatakam contains herbal extracts of Ashwagandha, Brahmi, Shankhpushpi, Vetiver, and Jatamansi. These plant extracts have been shown to improve overall mental health, including depression and anxiety.4.

647,"Hello doctor, I have flown very often in the last few years. I forgot to wear earplugs and slept on a few flights recently. On the last two trips, I had multiple flights connecting. I noticed my ears did not stop popping after a few days. Since my last flight, my right ear has not cleared up. It used to be at night my ear would pop and get better during the day. Now my right ear has lost hearing, I would estimate about 50% and fluctuates between 50% to 75% during the day. When it is totally silent, I think I hear this tone in my right ear. I do not have headaches and can sleep fine. I have gingivitis and bleeding gums, and no other health issues. I was wondering if my ear is infected or not. I know whatever I have is connected to my frequent flying every two months for the last five years. I always wore earplugs and never had this before but forgot the last trip. Should I take antibiotic drops? I definitely have mucus in my sinus and I am not sneezing or coughing in any major way just and not sure if I am infected or not. Would antibiotic drops help me rule out infection?","1. Yes, it is possible that your ear could be infected; however, there are many causes of this condition. You should see an ENT specialist first who will determine if the problem is related to Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) which occurs when the tubes become blocked and cause a build-up of pressure causing pain, hearing loss, ringing etc.2. The symptoms you describe are also suggestive of this type of problem.3. Treatment consists of using saline nasal sprays, decongestants, antihistamines and possibly steroid nasal sprays.4. In addition, an antibiotic may be prescribed depending on the results of lab tests.5. If the above measures fail, surgery may be necessary to open the blockage. Hope this helps."

651,"Hello doctor,I have erectile dysfunction with no apparent cause. Blood test and ECG are fine.I have never had ED. My sex drive is usually not even too much. For the past eight months, my sex drive is non-existent. I also have no morning erections. Factors that play a role are that I broke up with my wife and also eight months ago, I had serious accessory nerve operation that failed to fix my trapezius palsy, but I think these areas are physically too far apart. But maybe depression? I have not been able to think myself to be turned on. I have tried Zinc, Magnesium ZMA vitamin supplements which seemed to help for one week and I got hard morning erections. However, it stopped working. I have also tried Ginseng which does work as well as Tadalafil prescription works too. I can stimulate the penis with no medication too and ejaculate, but I usually have to look at porn (which I do not do often do because I have no libido, whatsoever). I have failed to have sex with three girls now because of lack of desire. I want to physically get it up, but it does not get up. I have ED, and I simply cannot get it up to beautiful women which is horrible.I have slight pain in both testicles which is I think because I have not masturbated. Feels like blue balls which are there when a man gets turned on but does not cum, so it hurts a little. No lumps are there on or in the testicles or anywhere else. No STDs of which I am sure because I had only five partners of which my ex-wife now was for last four years. All were protected sex. All tests came back normal. Only ECG said signs of hypertrophy but compared to ECG three years ago, not with any significant change so I doubt this is a reason. Also, note that the testosterone levels are fine. I usually get my eight hours of sleep but this may be because of sleep apnea. I never feel too rested."," Hi, Thanks for writing to us, The fact that your blood sugar is raised, means that you will have to take care of yourself, and avoid all sweets, fried foods, etc. Avoid getting overweight. And if you are overweight try to lose some weight. You need to check your blood pressure regularly. Erectile dysfunction could be due to many reasons like anxiety, stress, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, low testosterone levels, smoking, alcoholism, etc. So you should consult a psychiatrist and get evaluated for anxiety and stress related problems. You might need counseling sessions. As for your erection problem, you would need to undergo evaluation by a urologist who would investigate you thoroughly and rule out any organic causes for such problems. You might need some medications as well. Hope this helps."
652,"Hello doctor,I brush my teeth a minimum of twice, if not, once a day but my teeth have a yellow look to them. Is there anything I can use at home to help get them white. I have heard that charcoal tooth paste makes teeth white. Is this true or can you recommend something?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many products available which claim to whiten your teeth and some of these do work. However, it is important to know what kind of stains you have. If it is just surface staining due to tea/ coffee/ red wine etc., then bleaching with a dentist supervision will give good results.

654,"Hi doctor,I am a male. I had unprotected vaginal sex single exposure with a girl. Nine months later, I found she is HIV positive. My question: I have read that after a certain window period time (three months after getting negative) is conclusive and even after (six months) confirmation is definitely negative. But, why are all these other people saying you can go years without showing positive and that is really freaking me out big time. Is it true that it takes years to come up positive or does it only take six months to know it 100 %? What is true? Also, there is a doctor who says no test is 100 % reliable. I am still 15 months post exposure. HIV RNA PCR qualitative all are negative. 20 months post exposure, HIV-Alere combo test result is negative. Any further test is needed?I am negative now. Will my result change in the future? What is 100 % window period? Please clarify my doubts. Thank you.","1. The window period for HIV is from 3 months to 6 months. This means if you were exposed within this period then you will be able to detect HIV antibodies in your blood samples.2. People say that it may take years to develop symptoms of HIV but this is not entirely correct. It may take years before the virus starts replicating at high levels and causes symptoms.3. The Alere Combo test is a combination of HIV antigen and p24 antigens. The HIV antigen is detected earliest and the p24 antigen is detected later. Both tests are combined to get an early detection.4. As your HIV RNA is negative, you do not need any further tests as you are already negative. However, you should continue to practice safe sex and avoid risky sexual behavior."

After eight days, she bled and eight days later again she bled. She should get her menses by now, but still she did not get. We checked home pregnancy kit and it was negative. What could be the reason for delayed menses?","1. Your wife has taken two i pill in sequence, so there is very little chance that she can become pregnant.2.

Kindly suggest some cream."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Thanks for your query. There is no need of any medication or creams as this is not serious problem. It can be due to fungal infection (Tina corporal) or just infection of genitals. You may need antibiotics if there is fever associated with it.

664,"Hi doctor,I have heard that edging helps to maintain sexual excitement for an extended period. Is it true?"," Hi, Edging is a technique of delaying ejaculation by reducing stimulation gradually and then increasing stimulation again. It is not advisable to do this regularly as it may lead to premature ejaculation if done frequently. In my opinion, you should avoid masturbation for at least one week. You can try using condoms during sex to reduce stimulation. If these measures fail, you can consult your doctor who will prescribe medicines like SSRIs or paroxetine which act on serotonin receptors in brain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
665,"Hello doctor,My son is 1.7 years. He had rickets sometimes back and was put on supplements for six months. Upon taking him for review, alkaline phosphatase was extremely high but calcium level was okay and was referred to an endocrinologist. Upon doing several laboratory tests, TSH was okay, PTH was low, vitamin D levels were fine and wrist X-ray was normal. The boy cannot walk and does not look as if he will soon. When standing, he bends his legs at knee point and also clenches his fists when grasping. From the looks, he seems okay.

666,"Hello doctor,Since a long time now, my voice sounds blocked all the time, even when I do not have the flu. Recently, I visited the doctor, and he told me that I need to take my adenoids out after three months. But, I was wondering whether there is a 100 % chance that my voice will sound perfectly normal, post the surgery or is there a chance it will not work?"," Hi...I am sorry for your problem. This can be due to many reasons like: - chronic sinusitis-nasal polyps (rare)-adenoid hypertrophy(rare) - vocal cord paralysis(rare) - vocal nodules(common) - thyroid gland disorders etc. If I were your treating doctor, then I would first get an ENT opinion. Also, kindly get a laryngoscopy done by an ENT specialist. This will help in diagnosis. Then a course of antibiotics may be needed if there is any infection present.

667,"Hello doctor,Is coconut oil bad for the skin? A few years ago coconut oil was all the rage. We were told to slather it from head to toe for miraculous benefits. However, lately, it is been getting some backlash thanks to its comedogenic properties. My questions are, What are the pros of using products that contain coconut oil on your skin? What are some potential cons? What skin types can benefit most from coconut oil? What skin types should stay away from it? How do you recommend using coconut oil in one\s routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?","1. Coconut oil has many health benefits due to its high content of medium chain triglycerides which have antimicrobial properties.2. It is also rich in lauric acid which helps to fight against bacteria and viruses.3. It has anti-inflammatory effects due to its high content of capric acid.4. It has been used as a moisturizer for dry skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.5. It is also good at reducing wrinkles and fine lines since it contains antioxidants.6. It has been found effective in treating acne and other skin conditions such as rosacea.7. It is also beneficial for hair care and can be used as an all-natural conditioner.8. Unlike other oils, coconut oil does not clog pores or cause blackheads.9. It is also very effective as"
668,"Hello doctor,I noticed a small triangular bald spot in my beard three weeks ago. It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?","1) Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease wherein body attacks its own hair follicles leading to sudden patches of hair loss. Usually, it occurs in scalp but can occur anywhere, including beard area.2) Folliculitis is also caused by bacterial infection which occurs due to blockage of hair follicle by sebaceous gland secretions.3) Although your dermatologist might have thought it is folliculitis, it would be better if she/he examines it properly to rule out other possibilities like fungal infection etc.4) Since it is not clear from your post whether you have any other symptoms associated with it (like pain, fever, redness etc.), it will be better to get examined by dermatologist again.5) The fact that you have low WBC count could be due to some underlying problem or may just be coincidental.6) Low"

Please suggest what my next step should be?","150 copies/ml of plasma indicates low level of virus activity in your case, however it doesn't mean that you don't have HIV infection. Only if viral load is > 500 copies / ml it can be considered as active infection.

677,"Hello doctor,I am pretty sure that I have retrograde ejaculation because when I ejaculate it does not come out at the same moment of ejaculation, but it does come out seconds later and when I urinate there is some sperm. I also have male Incontinence and bedwetting problem since I was young and I am now 24 years old and a couple of times this year I found it hard to urinate, I felt like my bladder was numbed or something. So I went to a urologist and I had my testicles tested because I had pain there and thought it was the reason for all this. He gave me antibiotics I also did an ultrasound on my testicles and to check my kidney stones but everything was fine and after the antibiotics nothing change but the testicular pain.My urologist said he wants to do a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) but I do not know anything about the operation and he told me I will feel pain and I am scared of that but I also do not know why he wants to do this operation. I searched online and it says mercury retrograde might be from multiple sclerosis, week bladder muscle, problem with the nerves, a previous operation (does not apply to me) or medication side effect (does not apply to me).So I am not sure what to do? I want to check for multiple sclerosis and also look at my bladder muscles? Could it be a problem in the prostate? And is TURP necessary?

I have more than one problem and I want to know what is causing all this?","1. Retrograde ejaculation is due to failure of the seminal vesicle which stores the secretion produced by the prostate gland and other accessory organs of the genitourinary system.

679,"Hi doctor,After taking Unwanted 72, my wife got down within five days. But, her menses started again after five days though her actual time of menses not yet come. Why?",1st thing I would like to clear is that unwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill and it does work by preventing ovulation and also by thickening the cervical mucus which makes it difficult for sperms to enter the uterus. So if your wife has taken this pill in time then there should be no chance of getting pregnant but as you have noticed she has started having periods. The best way to know whether she had or didn't have a period while using this pill is to check out her basal body temperature. This will help you to find out if she was actually ovulating during those days.

I am a virgin. They said it was not a UTI and I was fine. I have had no pain or anything. Just now I peed and when I wiped there was blood in my discharge. It is not a lot but still freaks me out.

682,"Hi doctor,I have a question here. I had a toenail injury last month (cause: fell down, toe landing first onto the floor, which made the nail get loosened). I did go to the hospital to get it treated. The doctor cut off half of my nail, cleaned and dressed it, and kept re-visiting to get the dressing changed.

But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so.After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside).

The fact that your child has already received a prescription for glasses does not mean that they will need them forever. 2. It will probably take several years before the eye grows fully into its adult shape, so it is possible that the amount of correction needed might decrease over time. 3. The only way to know if the eye is going to get better or worse is to follow the progression of the eye. 4. In order to do this, the doctor would need to examine the eye every few months until it reaches full growth. 5. At that point, the amount of correction could possibly be reduced."

My test results show 6/18, -1.25 DC \xc3\x97 95, 6/6 and 6/9, -0.25/-0.75 \xc3\x97 75, 6/6. I would like to know whether my eye power is too weak. Is there any other way available to correct cylindrical power?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. The visual acuity of 6/18 means that your vision is 18/60 or less than 20/40. This may be due to astigmatism which can be corrected by using glasses. It is not clear from your question if you have been prescribed glasses earlier also. Also, it is not clear what was the refraction at the time of testing. Please get back with the details so that we can help you better."
696,"Hi doctor,Is it safe or risk to my healing process, if I smoke marijuana following a root canal treatment?"," Thanks for contacting us with your health concern. Marijuana is not recommended in any circumstances during a period of healing. It will impair the immune system and may slow down wound healing. If you are taking pain medication for the root canal, smoking cannabis may also interfere with the efficacy of the medications. In addition, smoking has many negative effects on the body including increased risk of cancer. Please consider quitting this habit as soon as possible."
697,"Hello doctor,I have been trying to conceive since 9/11/2014, which is when I stopped birth control pills and started prenatal vitamins.My cycles before BCP (Birth Control Pills) were always regular, about 30 days +/- 1 day with a 7 day period.And on BCP, my cycles were always 28 days, with a 5 day period.When I stopped BCP, I had a 5 day period, which began my first cycle of 31 days.The next cycle began with a 6 day period and the cycle lasted 37 days.Then this current cycle, which began with a four day period, a bit lighter than normal.I am currently on CD 27 and I believe I ovulated 3-4 days ago.So, the problem here is that I start spotting on CD 25, along with light cramping.It was only a very little bit of light brown blood, so I did not think much of it.Yesterday, CD 26, I had a little more throughout the day, then quite a bit right before bed.This morning, I am still spotting but much heavier than the past two days, and am starting to get a little alarmed by this.The blood is still brown. Any ideas on why this is happening, presumably 3-4 days past ovulation?Is this cause for concern? I have never spotted ever before.Also, I started taking Vitex at the beginning of this cycle in hopes of shortening my cycle a bit.Thank you in advance for any advice."," Welcome to Chat Doctor.com I am Chat Doctor.

698,"Hello doctor,I have injured urinary bladder and the left side ureter during hysterectomy surgery by laparoscopy. Then, cystoscopy and nephrostomy were done. A catheter is used. Can surgery be done again?",1. Cystoscope was not done to injure your urinary bladder or ureter.2. Uretero-pelvic junction injury is most common in laparoscopic hysterectomies.3. The risk of injury depends upon surgeon experience and expertise.4. You can undergo repair of ureter and bladder at the same time after removal of catheter.5. Repair may require open surgery if there is extensive injury involving multiple layers of muscle.6. Please consult your treating surgeon for further management. Thank you.
699,"Hello doctor,I went to the dentist three weeks ago and had some pain in my top molar and there turned out to be a cavity which I had filled and fixed but a few days later I started to feel the same pain in the tooth and went back to the dentist and he said he could not find anything wrong. I have this flap feeling on the top tooth and it is causing discomfort and pain to that area but nobody can tell me what is wrong with it. I think I may have a crack or some type of nerve ending there and it is really bothering me."," Hi thanks for asking question. Read your query. This is due to the filling material placed over the decayed portion of the tooth. As the filling material is hard and brittle, it might have caused fracture of the tooth underneath. This will cause pain and fissuring. You need to go for RCT(root canal treatment) as soon as possible. Consult an endodontist and get it done. For now take analgesics like diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily along with antibiotics like amoxicillin 500 mg TID for 5 days."
700,"Hello doctor,I am an 18 year old girl and I am starting to notice little moles all over my body. Nothing unusual or worrisome. My mother and grandmother are also covered in moles so I guess I should have expected it. My question is, is there a way that I can prevent them from coming in or at least slow down the process? I am most concerned about the ones on my face. I have a number of them under and around both of my eyes. They are still in the ""beginning stages"" I guess. They have not risen and you can only tell if you get close to me. But I am afraid that over time they will grow in and be harder to look over."," Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern for having moles all over the body. It seems like you have congenital nevi (moles) which are very common in people with a family history of moles. There is no specific treatment available for this condition. But, one option would be to go for surgery to remove these moles as they increase the risk of skin cancer. You could discuss with your dermatologist regarding the same. Hopefully, this helps. Take care"
701,"Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?"," Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As per your complaints it seems that you might be suffering from a condition called Urinary Tract Infection(UTI). This happens due to bacterial growth in the urinary tract causing inflammation and pain. You should get a urinalysis and urine culture test done to confirm the diagnosis. Avoid taking caffeine containing Chat Doctor.  You can get treated with antibiotics like Nitrofurantoin and metronidazole, along with anti-inflammatory medicines like Diclofenac sodium. Please consult a urologist for further evaluation and management. Hope this information helps. Let me know if I can assist you further."
702,"Hello doctor,I need advice regarding my eyes. I use computer up to 18 hours daily. I want to protect my eyes form damage as well. So let me know if any type of glasses is available. If so, then what is the name and characteristics of lenses used for protection from computer screen?", Hi thanks for asking question in Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. There are different types of glasses available in market which will help you to protect your eyes. These glasses are called as computer eyewear or photo chromatic lens. These glasses have photochromic properties that is they change their color according to ambient light. They are available in two colors blue and green. When you wear them while sitting in front of computer they turn darker with blue color and when you remove them they become clear. They also reduce the amount of blue light coming out of computer monitor. These glasses are quite helpful but not fully effective. You should also take regular breaks from computer work. Do exercise regularly and avoid eating junk food. Hope this information helps. Thanks.
703,"Hi doctor,I am a 53 year old female. My periods have been delayed for two weeks. Till now they are normally regular. Could it be the early onset of menopause or they will eventually come?"," Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. In some women, the period may get delayed after age of 40 years. Since you mentioned that your periods were regular before, I would suggest you wait for another week and if there is no sign of period then consult gynecologist as soon as possible. Your gynecologist can do few investigations like hormone levels etc. which are necessary in this case. Hope this helps you. Wish you good health. Regards"
704,"Hello doctor,I am a 31-year-old female. I think I have pinworms. My butt (perineal and anus area) kept vibrating like a cellphone, about once every two seconds, all day. I started taking probiotics and now it is not as constant, but happens many times a day still. I researched it, and some people say it could be worms. I took Reese\s Pinworm medicine and there were a few small half to one-inch white worms. My anus itches every now and then. Two days in a row it was very itchy. But it is not extra itchy at night, which is supposed to be the main symptom. I do feel them especially at night and it disgusts me.Do you think the cellphone-like vibrating is because of the worms? I am very disgusted, upset, and terrified. I think I got it from eating kale and spinach that I did not wash. I do work in a school, too. I heard apple cider vinegar is supposed to create an uninviting atmosphere for them. Does that mean if I drink it they will start coming out of me in various places, and alive or will I just poop them out?And garlic and carrots, would I just poop them out dead after eating these? I want to take lots of things to be rid of them, but do not want to see anything come out except my anus, and must be dead. I took the medicine only for four days. Will they take a while to go away?","1. The vibration you experience is common with pin worms.2. Apple Cider Vinegar will help reduce the number of pinworms, but it won't get rid of them all. You need to use medication for that.3. Garlic has antifungal properties, so it may be helpful in reducing the amount of pin worms.4. Carrot contains fiber, which helps to keep your digestive tract healthy.5. I recommend using medications such as Albenza (which contains albendazole).6. Take the medication for 2 weeks.7. After finishing the course, take a stool examination to confirm the diagnosis.8. If you don't see any improvement even after taking Albenza, consult your physician again.9. Also, continue taking probiotic supplements."

My hemoglobin is 16."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor.com I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that you have black spots over the nails which may be due to trauma or due to fungal infection. In case of traumatic injury there will be no symptoms associated with it whereas in case of fungal infection it causes pain, redness and yellow discoloration.

708,"Hello doctor,As suggested by most of the doctor marrying a girl with the same blood group will not cause any problems, in my case the blood group is A+ve. She is my maternal uncle\s daughter. She is a close relative. Can our marriage create a reduced genetic pool? Can I marry the girl? Will I have kids if I marry her? Will I have a future kid without genetic defects? What are tests needed to be done if I want to marry the girl in close relation first or second order? As I have read reduced genetic pool can create abnormalities as common genes which are suppressed may become active in the next generation. Please guide in this issue.","1. Reduced genetic pool is not a problem for your marriage and it does not mean that there will be any health issues in your child.2. In your case, there is no need to do any tests before marriage.3. You should get a complete hologram, hemoglobin electrophoresis, platelet count, CBC, lipid profile, TSH, FBS, PPBS, LFT etc. done before marriage.4. There is no need for any specific test to check for genetic defects.5. The reduced genetic pool will not cause any genetic defect in your child."
709,"Hi doctor,I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any.My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.","1) Your concern is understandable. 2) I can understand your problem.3) You need to be calm and relaxed. 4) The only way to get relief is to consult a good psychiatrist and discuss the issue. 5) If you want to continue the treatment, kindly consult a psychiatrist and tell him all these details.6) He might prescribe some more medicines like benzodiazepines or antidepressants in low doses to keep you under control."
710,"Hello doctor,I am 40 years old male, obese, non-smoking, non-alcoholic, non-diabetic. My lipids and blood pressure are controlled with Rosuvastatin 5 mg and Olmesartan 20 mg. My query is that I walk regularly brisk and my pulse goes up to 145 and 150 without any breathlessness and recovery is also good as it drops around 25 points within one minute. Does this mean my heart does not have plaque and I am safe? After 150 pulse, slight discomfort or maybe anxiety but no breathlessness. I am very scared to do TMT test but also anxious to know that if I am able to touch 150 pulse without any issue that means my heart is in perfect condition?","145 to 150 pulse rate is normal for a person of your age and weight. So there is nothing to worry about that. You can go for exercise with a heart rate of 150 bpm. As you said, after a few minutes your pulse comes down to near normal levels, so you should be fine. As far as TMT test is concerned, it is not mandatory. It is done only when a patient has symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, palpitation etc."

Since the past one month, she reported mild to moderate pain in the middle portion of her waist joint. She had taken three to four Ultracet tablets, applied ointment, and a hot bag.Although the pain is reduced, the waist joint is not that flexible as one month before. When we spoke this to our orthopedic doctor, he advised starting the spinal exercise in addition to her daily quadriceps and hamstring exercises. I request you to share some details on what exact exercise is suitable for her waist pain, some video or image link on how to do that and the number of times she needs to do it. She currently does 30 times of quadriceps exercise twice daily and five times of hamstring exercises twice daily. Please help."," Hi, I can understand your concern for your mothers condition. As you mentioned that she has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I would like to tell you that thyroid hormones play a major role in metabolic activities in our body. And any disruption in its functioning can lead to various symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, swelling of hands & legs, etc., besides other problems. Now if I were your treating physician, I would advise my patients to get their TSH levels checked once again. If they are still low then I would prescribe them with levothyroxine which will help in normalizing their thyroid hormone level. In case if they have high levels of TSH then I would advise them to start thyroid hormone replacement therapy at lower dosages.

712,"Hello doctor,I got a cavity last year. I have left it untreated. It hurt really bad a year ago and stopped, but is not occurring again. I have not gone to the dentist because I do not want to make my parents spend the money. So, I have just been dealing with it. But it hurts really bad. Is there anything I can do?","1) I would recommend that you visit your dentist as soon as possible.2) The pain may be due to infection of the pulp (nerve inside the tooth), or an abscess formation around the infected tooth.3) In either case, you need to get a root canal treatment done for the affected tooth.4) The cost of the procedure will depend on the number of roots present in the tooth, the complexity of the access and the type of filling material used.5) You can discuss this matter with your dentist before getting the treatment done."

Today, I noticed a small white spot beneath my tongue and a white area inside my cheek. I am very much worried about this. Please help me."," Hi, Thanks for your query. The white spots that you are seeing under the tongue may be due to deposition of salivary gland secretions or may be due to infection. As these are asymptomatic, no need to worry at present. However, if it persists then you can consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated. You can also take a course of antibiotics like Amoxicillin along with Metronidazole. Hope this helps."
714,"Hi doctor,My sister ate a bottle full of thyroid pills. She feels so weak and nervous every day. And she gets angry and her body temperature is always too warm and I searched the effect of too much of thyroid pills. Her age is 18 what should we do now?","1000 mg of thyroxine per day is an excessive amount to take for any adult let alone someone who is only 18 years old. It can cause symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, tremors, nervousness, irritability, increased heart rate, and weight loss. The thyroxine dose needs to be reduced. If your sister has been taking this dosage for some time, then she may also need to go through a period of tapered doses in order to allow the thyroid gland to reset itself. In addition, it is important to make sure that there aren't other underlying causes of hyperthyroidism such as Graves disease or a goiter."
715,"Hello doctor,I would like to know an orthopedist opinion about my mother\s situation. She had femur plasmacytoma 20 years ago and 4 prostheses, because she had many infections after the operations. She remained with her external popliteus paralyzed. Now, she began to feel his knee mobile, and she could not walk because of it. There are some noises too. A few doctors said she needs Megasystem-C Link prosthesis, which would totally replace her hip and knee. What is your advice? Is there any intermediate option, like replacing only the actual prosthesis and adding pieces of bone? We heard that, in case of choosing the Megasystem-C, that can lead to amputation.

The diagnosis of Plasma cell tumor is well known to be associated with destruction of bones. It has been suggested that replacement of the joint will help in stabilizing the fracture and also reducing the pain.

Firstly, let me tell you that there is no such thing called ""light-headedness"" or vertigo, if you mean by this that you feel dizzy then it can be due to low blood pressure, so please get yourself checked for this because it may require treatment. Secondly, nausea, abdominal pain, cramping, headache, neck stiffness etc. may be due to gastritis, ulcer, HERD, food poisoning etc., but since you have already mentioned that you have IBS then it's better to consult your physician and get evaluated thoroughly.

She has gone through retina eye laser and also has been injected in both her eyes almost 22 times for retinal leakage as well, has also gone through cataract eye surgery 16 years ago. At the moment her eye pressure remains between 21 to 24. The doctor says implants are necessary as she can see very less now. Given her eye condition is sensitive, a doctor has suggested that it is best to operate her with Ahmed valve implant, however, it has its own risks.

I want to get an opinion about this before thinking about Ahmed valve.",1. Thanks for your question. I am glad you asked it.2. Your mother is having advanced glaucoma and needs aggressive treatment.3. Glaucoma has its own risks and complications and they include blindness.4. The Ahmed valve is a good option but has some associated risks.5. XEN gel stent and INNOVATION micro shunt are new options which have fewer side effects than Ahmed valves.6. These are not FDA approved yet in US.7. They may be available overseas.8. You should consult a qualified glaucoma specialist who will advise you accordingly.9. Hope this answers your question.

So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same.

How can I cure this soon? I was concerned and decided to masturbate to check my semen, which was good (no blood). The penis skin is good and no bruising showing, just the swollen veins. I was forcing the foreskin back and do not know if I hit the vein, or etc. Please help.","1) As per your history, you seem to have got a phimosis, which is an inability to retract your foreskin over the glans penis. This might be due to inflammation of the fibrous tissue underneath the foreskin. You need to consult urologist and get evaluated. Treatment options include surgical removal of the foreskin (circumcision), physical therapy, oral medications like antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines.2) Inflammation of the veins in the penile shaft may be secondary to injury to the vessels at the time of trauma to the foreskin.3) Masturbating will not cause any harm to the penis. It will only relieve your anxiety."

727,"Hi doctor,  Last month, I was given a Depo shot to stop intermenstrual bleeding that started before six months after Provera tablets did not work. Unable to do a pap smear because of the bleeding. Transvaginal Ultrasound revealed tiny (1x1.3cm) uterine fibroid, three hemorrhagic cysts, and a heterogeneous endometrial cavity.

Please help."," Thanks for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that having fibroids is common in women of childbearing age, and they usually don't cause problems unless they get too large. They are benign tumors made up of muscle and fibrous tissue and can vary in size from pea-sized to as large as a melon. Fibroids usually don't cause any symptoms and may only be detected during an ultrasound examination. However, sometimes they can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, painful periods, urinary frequency, constipation, and infertility. It is important to know whether your fibroids are causing these symptoms or not. You should consult with your gynecologist and discuss the symptoms you have been experiencing and get further evaluation and treatment if necessary. Hope this helps!"

730,"Hello doctor,No one is diabetic in my whole family. My sugar levels are fluctuating. My sugar levels in the past three months were 110 mg/dl, 107 mg/dl and 122 mg/dl for pre-lunch and post-lunch were 83 mg/dl, 120 mg/dl and 172 mg/dl respectively. I have never taken any medicine for diabetes.",110 mg / dL (6.1 mmol / L) fasting blood glucose level is normal. That means your body is able to produce sufficient insulin to maintain your blood glucose at this level after not eating for about 10 hours. You should check your blood glucose again between 45 minutes and 90 minutes after eating something containing carbohydrates. It will be higher than the fasting level. This rise in blood glucose is due to the action of insulin which your body produces to digest the food. After that it should come down again to the fasting level within two hours. This is called the peak response or the area under curve (AUC). The AUC value can help to know how well your body is responding to the insulin produced by the pancreas. The AUC values of more than 80% are considered good.

Tinnitus is a symptom of many diseases, but in most cases, its cause remains unknown. It may be because of ear disorders, such as earwax buildup, or sinus issues, such as sinusitis.

757,"Hi doctor,I took my mother to a dentist. She hit the tooth hard with a hammer and chisel to remove the second molar of upper jaw.

My mother cried because of fear. I am looking forward to hear from you. Thank you.","1) It is very important that the dental surgeon wears sterile gloves while performing any surgical procedures.2) The reason why doctors wear gloves is to avoid contamination of their hands by bacteria which can cause infection.3) Whenever there is bleeding from the oral cavity, it is necessary to wear a mask to prevent spreading of bacteria in the air through coughing or sneezing.4) Even if there is no bleeding, the bacterial load in saliva is high and therefore it is better to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.5) Anytime a person is performing a dental procedure, they should be wearing gloves to protect themselves and the patient."

Hope this answers your question."
759,"Hello doctor,I am an epilepsy patient. I got seizure before three weeks. There was a brain trauma nine months back. The CT and MRI showed only tumor and no other problem. Last week, the EEG report showed normal. How to find whether the seizure is caused by the tumor or by the trauma or both?","1) Tumors can cause seizures either directly (by direct compression of brain structures or by metabolic changes in the tumor itself) or indirectly (by hormonal effects). However, this is not usually seen with benign tumors.2) Trauma can also cause seizures if there is any damage to the brain from the injury.3) In your case, it would be best to get a repeat MRI scan to look for any new lesions or changes that may have occurred since the last scan. This will help determine if the seizures are being caused by the tumor or trauma.4) You should discuss these issues with your neurologist."
760,"Hi doctor,About 13 years ago, I had an abscess on the right upper first and second molars. The Endodontist has done root canal treatment in these teeth and crowns were placed after the treatment. Recently, I experienced pain around the gums in the second molar and there is a pain radiating to the head. I went to my dentist. He examined and took an X-ray which looked fine. The crown was removed and cleaned by the Hygienist with a Listerine or Peroxide mix. There were food particles and they cleared the food particles present in the crown. My dentist advised me to take tablet Zyrtec every day. The teeth still have a dull type of pain. Could it be an issue of the crown that has not been shown on the X-ray or there is any allergies?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you are having pain in your teeth, it can be due to many reasons like decay under the filling, decay between the teeth, or an abrasion of the fillings. You should consult your Dentist for this problem. If required he will examine and treat accordingly. You may need Root Canal Treatment of the affected tooth. Hope this helps you. Thanks"

The nuchal translucency is normal which indicates that there is no increased chance for Down Syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities.2. The biochemical risk is high but this can also be due to hormonal imbalance in the mother. This may not lead to any complications.3. The ultrasonography shows gestational age of 12 weeks which is less than the date of conception. This indicates that there is a delay in the development of the fetus.4. This is an indication that the fetus needs more time to develop and it will take longer to reach full term. As such there is nothing to worry about.
763,"Hello doctor,I am on a holiday. I wish to delay my period. Kindly advice.",1. Please take a pill of oral contraceptive (birth control pills) for 21 days in place of your regular menstruation day. This will delay your periods by 7-10 days.2. Do not have sex during this time as it may cause pregnancy.3. Take progesterone tablets from Day 16 to Day 25 of the cycle to maintain pregnancy.4. Have unprotected sex from Day 11 to Day 18 of the cycle to maximize chances of pregnancy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
764,"Hello doctor,Recently, I was diagnosed to have iron deficiency anemia. My primary doctor thinks this is due to heavy menstrual bleeding. Therefore, he advised me to see the gynecologist. I never thought I had heavy periods. What is the actual definition of heavy menstrual bleeding? My period always last for seven 7 days and the first 2 or 3 days will be heavier with some clots. I have to get up during the night once to change the pad only in the first two nights. I usually use about 25 to 30 pads during my periods. Can this be considered as heavy bleeding? For me, this is normal. I have always been this way. My laboratory report showed hemoglobin 8.5, hematocrit 29.7, MCV 66, MCH 19, MCHC 28.6, RDW 18.9, UIBC 430, serum iron 15 and iron saturation and ferritin 3. In addition, I am not sexually active and I am still a virgin. I have never been to the gynecologist and really do not know what to expect. What kind of examination the doctor will perform? How should I prepare for the visit? Please visit."," Hi, Thanks for your query. Iron deficiency anemia can occur due to various reasons like blood loss from gastrointestinal tract, heavy periods, pregnancy, excessive menstruation, etc. You may need to take medicines along with iron supplements. Your doctor may also advise you to take vitamin B complex which helps in absorption of iron. Your doctor will examine you thoroughly. He/she may ask you for complete blood count, peripheral smear examination, bone marrow aspiration, ultrasound of abdomen. If required he/she may even suggest colonoscopy. Get well soon.

765,"Hello doctor,My wife is 13 weeks and 5 days pregnant at present. She vomits in the mornings, and she has continuous light stomach pain. Once or twice a day, she has intense stomach pain for 5 to 7 minutes. She takes Doxinate tablet once a day. Is this type of pain common in pregnancy? Can she take Doxinate throughout her pregnancy? Will Digene help in these type of stomach pain and is it safe during pregnancy?", Thanks for contacting us. Doxycycline (Doxinate) is an antibiotic that can be used in pregnancy if there is a risk of developing an infection. It is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless clearly needed as it may cause harmful effects on the fetus. The symptoms your wife is experiencing could be related to acid reflux. This is quite common during pregnancy and is caused by hormonal changes. There are medications that can be taken safely in pregnancy to treat this condition including proton pump inhibitors like Omeprazole or Pantoprazole. I recommend discussing your wives case with her obstetrician who can advise further treatment.
766,"Hi doctor,If I have had an open heart surgery, how long should I take Warfarin for?", Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern.

Its dosage needs to be adjusted according to INR level (international normalized ratio). Your dose of warfarin will be decided by your cardiologist.

768,"Hello doctor,My dentist went for a crown for my molar because my molar was too sensitive. Now the sensitivity has reduced but not gone completely. My crown was fixed before two years. What can I do?"," The tooth is very close to the gum line and hence it is possible that there may be some inflammation of the nerve fibers in the pulp chamber which would cause increased sensitivity. This will go away with time. Do not chew ice or hard food. Avoid biting on the opposite side. Use desensitizing toothpaste like Sensodyne. If still the problem persists, then you should get an x-ray done to rule out any other pathology."

770,"Hi doctor,I and my fiancee do use condoms but sometimes condoms cause me pain due to size issues. So, we get into an intercourse without it. Basically, I never came inside her but I wanted to get educated about the facts like how to avoid pregnancy if I came inside her? I mean what should be our first step? Even if I pull out, is there any chances that she will get pregnant? Which condom is a perfect fit for starters like us? Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?","1) You can try using a smaller size condom or a female condom.2) Withdrawal of penis before ejaculation in the vagina is considered as one of the most effective methods of contraception.3) However, this method has its own limitations because it requires practice and proper timing. It also needs good knowledge and understanding of the woman.4) Also, there are high chances of slipping off or breaking during sexual activity.5) Another option could be using a diaphragm which is a small cup shaped device made up of soft rubber.6) This is placed inside the vagina before having sex.7) It is not very effective in preventing pregnancies unless used with another form of birth control. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
771,"Hello doctor,My husband is away from the past one and half years due to his work. I visited him for 15 days. I had my normal periods there on the 31st of last month.

I visited my GP four weeks ago who immediately prescribed anti-depressants. I have suffered from health anxiety for the last seven years. It comes in waves. The GP did not even check me over and told me not to worry as he had no concern. I am worrying about motor neuron disease.

But of late, any outside sound like flushing toilet increases the volume of tinnitus. Left ear 6/10 and right ear 4/10. The sound is the insect cricket sound. Moreover, since two weeks, I have serious sleep problems. It happened after my exposure to music played by a bus in which I traveled for five hours. That night, the sleeping problems started.

778,"Hi,I sprained my ankle while playing soccer. The ball hit the outside of my foot, causing my ankle to turn inward, and it popped few times. I also landed on it sideways in the same position. They took me to the hospital, where they told it was a moderate sprain. At first, it hurt to walk, but it did not hurt the following days. The doctor put me on crutches and a splint, which I only used for a day. It has been a week since I sprained it, there is still the pain in the top part of the ankle. The swelling went from none, to swollen to little swelling. I can play on it, but sometimes I feel pain. I have gone to my chiropractor twice, and it is still very tender around the top part of the ankle and the side of the leg, where those ligaments go upward. There is still slight pain while pointing my foot and turning it outward.My main concern is when I am sitting with my legs on the table, and when I try turning my ankle inward, I feel as though something in my ankle is shifting (like something is dislocated). My chiropractor tried adjusting the ankle, and it popped, but it did not affect the dislocated feeling. I have asked other people who I know have sprained their ankle, but they said they have never felt that. Should I be concerned? I am currently taking Advil."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

779,"Hello doctor,A stray dog came near my 3 years and eight months old toddler. Its mouth was very near his hand. I do not know if it licked his hand or not but I just got worried.

I did not see the dog licking his hand but was very close to his hand, maybe for sniffing it came near.The dog looked fine, not overactive or underactive. It was a stray dog, so cannot watch it also. Please suggest what to do. Such incidents wherein a dog comes near or sniffs might happen in the future also and with kids, you cannot be sure if they were licked or not.","1) Is the child having any swelling or redness at the site?2) If there is no redness or swelling then there is nothing to worry about. Tetanus immunization is supposed to give protection against tetanus for five years. So your kid should have received the last injection before he turned three years. If he had received all the necessary vaccines then he is protected from tetanus.3) However, if the dog had an active case of rabies then your kid can get infected (rabies). But this would show up symptomatically only after few days.4) The best way to prevent such incidences is to keep your child away from stray dogs.5) If the dog had rabies and bites your kid, then you need to take him to hospital immediately for anti-rabies treatment.6) If the dog had rabies then it would die within 7-10 days"

The sex time is only one minute.",1) Average length of penis for an adult male is approximately 3 inches.2) Penis can grow up to 4 inches with erection.3) Erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation may be related to anxiety and stress.4) Try not to worry about your penis size.

794,"Hello doctor,My 2-year-old son has hard motions. He has just had his circumcision surgery. My friends advised me to apply Lignocaine Hydrochloride gel between his buttocks. By mistake, I applied more. I am very much worried. I hope it is not harmful. Please advice."," Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. The application of lignocaine gel seems to be unintentional and was likely overlooked while applying the medicine to the infants genital area during circumcision. There won't be any harm if he doesn't have any allergic reaction to this, but since there might be some irritation due to the excessive application of medicines, you can keep an eye on him for any signs of redness or swelling at the site of application."
795,"Hi doctor,After suffering with groin pain, I had a double operation 12 weeks ago. During the operation, I had a repair of left side inguinal hernia and right hand hydrocele. I am now in more pain than I was before the operation. My testicle thorns with pain constantly and I have stabbing pain on hernia side. It feels like someone is sticking a bottle in me. I am struggling to walk very far, climb stairs and drive. I am unable to have a sex life. Is it normal to do both operations at the same time? Can you explain any possible cause for pain?"," Hello, The pain that you are experiencing can be because of the surgery itself or could be because of the scar tissue formation. Inguinal hernias are common and can recur. Hence, if you are able to tolerate the procedure then it is worth trying. If not, then the other option would be to go for mesh repair as well. Mesh repairs are known to be less painful and have a lower rate of recurrence. You may need to consult your surgeon for further evaluation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

From a few months, my mother is suffering from chest pain. The doctor told it is chronic stable angina. All other tests are done like Na, K, hemoglobin, urea, and uric acid.

She is taking the following medicines: Aciloc RD, Glimmy 2, Nexovas, Telmikaa40, Febugood 40, Lipikind 10 and Glypten 20.","1. Chronic angina is due to blockage in heart arteries leading to decreased blood supply to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), nausea, vomiting and sweating. It can also be associated with arm or jaw pain. 2. Your mother needs to undergo Angiogram to know whether she has significant blockages in her heart arteries. If there are no blockages then she may need only medications for control of her symptoms."
798,"Hello doctor, I am currently taking a low dose of combined birth control medication (Femme 20/100) containing 21 hormone tablets and 7 placebo tablets. I was on a higher dose of contraceptive medication (Microgynon 30). Microgynon 30 was switched to lower dose pill because of severe PMS type symptoms. Currently, I am taking Ritalin 60 mg per day in 3 x 20 mg intervals, Abilify 300 mg depot injection monthly, Femme 20/100 contraceptive pill and Clonazepam 2 mg twice a day as needed. I had unprotected sex on day 6 of inactive pill. I forgot to take active pills on day 1, 3 and 4. But, I had 2 pills on day 2 and had unprotected intercourse. I am concerned about the possibility of pregnancy. It is now day 5 and I am regular on my pill. Am I at risk for a possible pregnancy due to missing so many hormonal pills? Also, what should I do from this point onwards? Should I continue as normal or begin a new packet entirely?"," Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Thanks for calling Chat Doctor. Forum. As your question is concerned, it is not clear how much time you have missed the pills. If you miss one pill within the first week it won't affect you. You can start with the next pack. If you miss two weeks then you need to check by urine test to know if you are pregnant or not. If you are pregnant, then you will be advised to terminate the pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, you can resume the pills. Hope this answers your query."
799,"Hello doctor,Me and my partner had unprotected sex, and she took I-pill within 72 hours (but after 24 hours), and now after 8 to 9 days of taking the pill, she is having mild cramps similar to period and also mild bleeding (just a few spots), but the discharge is brownish in color, and this is the third day with cramps, although the bleeding is very less. Is it side effect of the pill or is it implantation bleeding? And when can she expect her normal periods?",1. I-pill is not used as emergency contraceptive anymore. It contains high doses of hormones which cause irregular menstrual cycles and spotting for a few months. This may be due to the I-pill.2. It is unlikely that it is implantation bleeding because she has taken it after 24 hours of intercourse.3. You should wait for your next period to come. Implantation bleeding occurs about a week before the expected date of period.
800,"Hi doctor,My son is 14 years old. He got a seizure before 15 days during sleep for 10 to 15 minutes. His EEG and MRI are normal. His doctor suggested two options.

Mariano Into Bruno Mascaras. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. Epilepsy has many causes, including damage to the brain from trauma, infection, stroke, or tumor. A child who has had one seizure may not need treatment if he or she has no other symptoms and does not have any problems afterward. However, some children will continue to have seizures even though they do not appear to be aware of them. These children should take anti-epileptic medications.

801,"Hi doctor,I do a couple of sports to have some hip flexibility. I am pretty flexible, and I can do right and left splits. But when doing the center split, I get a stopping pain in my outer hip with no stretch in my inner thigh. If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. The center split you are referring to is called as the ""splitting"" of the leg. This is done by rotating the foot inwards while keeping the knee straight. When you do this, your whole body weight gets transferred to the front side of the knee. This is where the pain originates from. When you rotate the knee backwards and hips forward, the pressure is shifted to the other side and hence the pain reduces. It is possible to reduce the pain through stretching exercises. You should start with gentle stretching of the groin muscles and then gradually move onto full splits. However, if the pain persists even after adequate stretching, you may need to consult a physician who will advise you further investigations like X-ray, MRI etc. In case it is a ligament injury, physical therapy along with medicines will help."

Other sensory triggers the pain. It has become just way too much to handle.

And whether you had any prior cardiac condition or not. Also, what is your ECG report? How long did you have symptoms before you were hospitalized?

I have a medical phobia, so have not been to the doctor unless it was an emergency. But over 20 years ago I ended up going to the ER and had several tests. I was told I had lupus, osteoarthritis, PCOS, and thyroid issues. I have tried to treat myself and pain naturally over the years with a healthy lifestyle and natural aids, but the pain finally became so bad over the last couple of years that I have gone to some appointments.I was referred to a rhuematologist that did blood work and said I was fine except low vitamin D. I told the new doctor about the early diagnosis and she said it was probably wrong but she would run blood test anyway.

810,"Hello doctor,I am a 20 year old female and had sex for the first time. I took Regestrone to delay my periods because I planned to get intimate the same day as my periods. I took them for three to four days before my expected period date and had the tablet two to three times a day. Last dose I had it just the night before having sex. I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful. But ignored it thinking it was because of hormonal imbalance. Both of us were affected by flu and it turned into a stomach infection with alternate periods of diarrhea and constipation that was accompanied with mild nausea but had no vomiting. I became very weak and then eventually recovered by taking Pantocid, Digene and Zandu pancharishta. I am six days overdue and had slight back pain, nausea and increased urination.

In the meantime, take plenty of water and eat healthy food.3) You should also undergo a pelvic ultrasound to rule out any pathology like ovarian cysts or fibroids which may cause delayed periods."

819,"Hi doctor,My daughter has skin lesions that started last year. They are on one side of the body. Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo.He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream.Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues?We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment? I can send in the photos. I uploaded the photos:They all are on one side of the body (right side).On the hand, it started four months ago with a small white patch and gradually increased to the size and then we are seeing some repigmentation slowly very slowly to normal skin color.On the chest also, it started around the same time this year and not increased and stable.On the neck, it started early last month and it is not that whitish (like little less brownish).As said, the doctors diagnosed differently (postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor and finally vitiligo) so far and we are confused. Could you please look into this and help us?In all these spots, we applied Corticosteroid last year for eczema (hand, neck, chest and back) at the same spots where the white patches started and then grown big now. The only spot where we have not applied Corticosteroid but observed white patch is on the eye. We started seeing a white patch on the right eye as well from the last three weeks."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As your daughter is having skin lesions, starting from the last year, it seems to be an autoimmune disease. She should consult a dermatologist for further management.

So, don't worry about it, and if there is any problem in the pregnancy, it will show up in the ultrasound report. Hope this helps, Take care"

829,"Hi doctor,I went for an HIV test at six weeks after low-risk exposure and get false positive. At eight weeks both fourth generation and HIV RNA PCR are negative. At 9 and 10 weeks rapid test is negative. At 12 weeks HIV RNA PCR is negative. Is it conclusive? My doctor told me no need for further tests."," Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern regarding HIV infection. In my opinion, you have very less chance of having HIV infection. As per your history, you had unprotected sex with your partner who was also not tested as HIV positive. The false positive result could be due to cross reaction or some other factors. You should wait for another three months before going for next HIV test. If you repeat the test again in three months time, and if that too comes out to be reactive then only you should go for confirmatory testing like Western blot test. Hope this helps you. Take care."

831,"Hello doctor,Last week I took three pregnancy tests and all three came back positive. This morning I woke up and was cramping and bleeding like I would with my normal period only a little lighter. Is this something to be concerned about?","1st thing is that it is not a normal period, as you have conceived.2nd thing is that this is usually due to implantation bleeding which occurs early in pregnancy when fertilized egg attaches itself to uterine wall.3rd thing is that this does not happen every time, so don't worry too much.4th thing is that if you are confirmed pregnant then get an ultrasound done to check for fetal heart beat.5th thing is that these symptoms can also occur if you are not pregnant.6th thing is that you should wait for your next expected menses to come, or confirm the pregnancy by doing urine pregnancy test after one week of missing the periods.7th thing is that you should consult your physician and discuss the above things with him/her. Hope I answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."

838,"Hi doctor, My last exposure was protected but I am not sure about whether the vaginal fluid touched or not since I was drunk that time.

Then I took HbsAg, HCV, VRD total all are non-reactive.Is it enough for HIV testing? Is DNA PCR at 66 days (in window ) period useful? Is tridot test useful or not?In the window period time, I used fever tablets, antibiotics, and Levocetirizine many days. Will it affect my window period? Please give me brief information. I have a family and a child. Can I have sex with my wife without protection? Next test needed or not?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. I understand your concern. The tests that you have done are appropriate for your situation. DNA PCR test is done when there is a possibility of exposure by genital secretions. It can detect HIV for up to 66 days after exposure. Tridot test is done to detect HIV antigen in blood. It may be positive even if viral load is very low. You should do this test only once as it has high false positive results. The immunofiltration test is done to detect antibody against HIV. It requires fresh serum sample. If it is negative then you need not worry about HIV. You can have unprotected sex with your wife provided she is not infected. However, if she is infected then she needs to take precautions and get tested."

845,"Hello doctor,I am currently on 40 mg of Fluoxetine. For the past four days, I was put up from 30 mg to 40 mg as my 20 mg stopped working after three years. While on the 30 mg, my symptoms got better for a couple weeks and then I went back down to where I was, in the beginning, feeling extremely depressed, anxious and completely awful. I was wondering why this happened?","1) It is common that when we increase the dose of fluoxetine its effectiveness decreases due to tolerance effects. So it may be possible that your dosage has not been increased enough to get effective results.2) Also, if you have an underlying condition like hypothyroidism or diabetes, which can cause depression and anxiety, it is likely that your current medication will not work well.3) If you have any other psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia etc., you should continue taking your medications regularly."

I am scared that there could be something wrong and I have no other symptoms besides shortness of breath.","15% of normal population has some variation in their ECG, so it is not necessarily pathological unless it is prolonged or associated with other symptoms.

848,"Hi doctor,I am a 28-year-old female. I have always had a small, raised, symmetrical mole on the right side of my chin. It has always been very benign and had a hair growing out of it that I consistently plucked. About two weeks ago, I noticed a small, shiny whiteish bump on the mole and called my dermatologist. Because of the holidays, I could not get an appointment anytime soon and still have another week to wait. Over the last couple of days, the mole has gotten bigger though it has stayed symmetrical and is still slightly smaller than a pencil eraser. It is slightly more raised and it stings to touch. I also realized that it has been a month or two since I had to pluck any hair. None has grown.I have had a zit on this mole a couple times but this does not really look like the previous moles. I am conscious it could be another more severe zit or maybe a cyst but I am very nervous that it is cancer. I had a couple of moles removed in childhood that were not quite suspicious but that the dermatologist removed just to be safe. My mother has had several basal cell cancers removed.

850,"Hello doctor,I began presenting last fall with some chronic fatigue. The initial blood work showed low iron saturation without anemia. I have attached reports of the same. There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ng/mL and had increased to 30 ng/mL.I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue. I have also received a range of conflicting advice about whether to continue iron supplementation. One doctor told me to continue taking the iron until the ferritin is up around 50 or so. Another said that would be unnecessary and to discontinue it and wait for three months to re-measure the blood work. It is all quite puzzling. Please help me to understand iron\s role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof. And finally, please give me some sense of when iron toxicity emerges in terms of blood work measurements and at what frequency one needs to check the iron levels during any supplementation."," Hi Thanks for asking question. Iron deficiency anemia is common condition. It is caused by reduced iron stores in body or decreased absorption from diet. Iron deficiency may result in symptoms such as tiredness and weakness. Iron is essential for production of hemoglobin and red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body. Iron is found in many foods including meat, poultry, fish, legumes, fortified cereals, and iron-rich vitamins and minerals. Iron has multiple functions in human body. It helps in transport of Oxygen to tissues and organs of body. It also plays important role in formation of proteins, nucleic acids and enzymes. Iron deficiency can lead to fatigue and decrease in physical performance. Iron toxicity is very rare but can occur if large amount of iron is taken.

My dentist said it is fine, but I am very worried as I have heard this antibiotic is very toxic. What is your advice concerning this issue, please?"," Hi, thanks for posting your query at Chat Doctor. As per my opinion, levofloxacin is one of the safest antibiotics available in the market today. It is being used in many countries worldwide. It is also known that it can cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea etc., but they are usually not serious enough to stop taking the medication. As far as combining augmenting with ibuprofen and dexamethasone is concerned, there is no contraindication between these three medications. You can take all of them together without any problem.

I am able to exercise and lift heavy objects, but not able to walk more than a mile at a time. I believe the stenosis is more of an issue right now than the disc herniation, and my MRI confirms the disc is not as bad as it was years ago.I have done physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, and epidural injections, but, my lower back pain remains an issue (especially when standing and walking for a long time). My doctors recommend a laminectomy, though I am scared that surgery may leave me in worse shape than I currently am. Can I have some advice? Should I go through with the laminectomy, or should I deal with the back pain since I have built a high tolerance for pain and can do most (but not all) activities?"," Hi, Thanks for writing in. From your history, it seems you have chronic back pain with radiating pain down the legs. Lumbar spondylitis and spinal stenosis are common causes for this. The treatment options would be conservative or surgical depending on severity. Physiotherapy and medicines like muscle relaxants, analgesics etc., help reduce symptoms. Epidural injections are helpful in relieving pain temporarily. Surgical option includes laminotomy/laminectomy if there is severe nerve compression leading to weakness and neurological deficits. You need to discuss with your treating physician about these issues. Hope this helps."
859,"Hi doctor,I am 47 years old female. Before a year, I went to the ER with pain during breathing. My D dimer was elevated at 700 ng/mL. CT scan was negative for a clot.

You can get an ultrasound of the abdominal region done to rule out any other causes of thrombosis. For now continue with the medication and monitor the levels of the d-dimer.

865,"Hello doctor,From the past five days, I am sending my 21 month old son to a daycare. For the first three days, they allowed me inside the campus. Since I was close by, he was playing well. But, from the last two days, they are not allowing me inside and hence he is crying a lot. Today he was a bit fine but, not actually enjoying. Will it affect my child\s health? Will it create any psychological problem in him? I have heard that the cortisol hormone levels will be changed. Is that true? My in-laws are not staying with us. So, I have to either send him to the day care or I will have to send him to my in-laws\. Which is the best option?",1. The daycare facility should be able to understand your situation and allow you to be around when ever possible. It would be better if there were some other parents who could come and help out so that the kid can get used to being without you.2. Crying for long periods of time can cause stress. Stress can lead to changes in hormones which may result in behavioral problems.3. The best option would be to find a place where you can take care of your child yourself. This would be the most ideal situation since then you can be sure that your needs and your kids needs are taken care of simultaneously.

Also, her bone density is extremely low, I do not have her last report, but when did three years ago, it came to be very low.The proposed diagnosis by the doctor, says minor fracture, and since it is in the hip area, plaster cannot be done.

The first thing that I would like to say is that the symptoms described here are not due to fracture. The x-ray taken shows normal bones without any fracture. The only problem with the bones is osteoporosis. It is a condition in which the bones become weak and fragile. This can lead to fracture easily.

868,"Hello doctor,After two weeks of LMP, I had mild cramps and non-stop light vaginal bleeding, it lasted for three days. I experienced non-stop light vaginal bleeding, once again after this month periods. This morning, I started to have light bleeding again. Given my concerns, I had bloodwork this week; my blood counts are normal; my thyroid, hormones and pituitary gland levels are all normal; and I am not on birth control. However, my urinalysis revealed that my erythrocyte is 25, my leukocyte esterase is 0.3 mg/L, and my eGFR is 88. Plus, my ferritin is 10.Initially, my doctor believed my abnormal bleeding between my periods was due to a hormone imbalance but we now know that it is obviously not the case. Can this be due to gynecological cancers? I am only 32, I am healthy, I am not on birth control, I am not pregnant, I am not on hormones, and the possibility of having cancer makes no sense to me. I would appreciate talking to someone because I am terrified."," Hi dear, I understand your concern. You are right in thinking that there may be some problem with uterine lining or endometrium. The cause could be many like hormonal imbalance, polycystic ovarian syn Chat Doctor.  In such cases if the bleeding is heavy then it needs to be evaluated by doing a sonogram of pelvis. This will help us to see the thickness of endometrium & if any cyst is present which is causing problems. Then we can plan further management accordingly. Hope this helps."

During the act, my condom slipped, but there was no exposure to my bare penis. I could not achieve an erection, so she removed the condom and applied lotion on my penis. My question is,1. Can her vaginal fluids enter my exposed penis as she applied lotion, making me infective (unknown status)?2. I had two p24 tests done at four and nine weeks. Both came negative. Should I go to 12 weeks or is this conclusive? Is there any chance of turning negative to positive?3. I feel swollen lymph node in my neck which occurred close to 12 weeks now. Am I HIV infective? Please help with your reply, and I am getting stressed.","1. No, it does not mean that you are infected if you didn't have sexual intercourse. You should get tested for HIV after 6 months.2. The result of test at 4-week may be false negative. But it is very unlikely to turn from negative to positive within 8 weeks.3. It can be a viral infection. Swelling of the lymph nodes might indicate infection. So you need to do blood work up."

The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea.

Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea. It subsided when I was given an antidote by the doctor immediately. From then onwards I was reluctant to take any of my medicines and undergo any treatment. I just focussed on improving my diet. Recently upon doctor's advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 \xb5IU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 \xb5g/dL, TIBC: 527 \xb5g/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL.

874,"Hello doctor,How can I figure out my conception date? My last menstrual period was three months back. I had my dating ultrasound and it put the GA at 9 weeks and 3 days. Also there was a CRL measurement of 26.96. My due date based on LMP and ultrasound are different. Please answer. Also how many ""safe"" days are there after a period?","1) The most accurate way to calculate the conception date is by counting from the first day of your last normal menses (LNM). This would mean that if you have a regular 28-day cycle, then the conception date could be calculated as 14 days before the expected ovulation day. However, this calculation is not always reliable as not all women have regular cycles with the same length every month. For those who do not have a regular cycle or whose cycles vary in length, the safest way to calculate the conception date is by using the calendar method. 2) The safest days for conception are the 10 to 17 days prior to expected ovulation day."

I do not have any health issue and morning erection is positive.","1) If your partner is normal then there should be no problem in intercourse.2) If you are losing erection at the time of penetration it may be due to anxiety or performance anxiety.3) You can take anxiolytic like alprazolam before sex, but if you are taking it regularly then you need to consult psychiatrist.4) If your erections are good in the morning then you can try intracavernous injection for maintaining erection during sexual activity.5) Avoid stress and tension about sex."

891,"Dear Doctor,I am a 29 year old female suffering from PCOD, taking medicines from past 1 year. But still it has not reduced. I was into Metformin and Folic acid. At the same time I have also taken medicines for conception (i.e, clomiphene).Follicar study has been conducted for four times and only once the egg ruptured, but I did not conceive.From december onwards the follicles are not maturing upto required level.Again during February and March my doctor put me on K-35 as my periods during past 1 year were not regular and still are irregular (I have to take tablet Norgest thrice daily for 5 days and then periods come).Recently I have consulted another doctor, she has prescribed me to stop taking Metformin and instead to start on APCOD sachet (Myo-inositol) and Safegest D (dehydroepiandrosterone) and during periods Adova (Anastrozole).But I have not yet started the medicines. I am a bit confused, whether should I totally stop Metformin and start with these new drugs?","1. You need to take metformin as its help in ovulation induction and maintenance of pregnancy. 2. You can try other medications like APOD, safeguard D, Anastrazole etc. 3. But first get your hormonal profile done and see if there is any imbalance and correct that first. 4. Also make sure that the ovum size is good enough to be picked up by fallopian tube. 5. As far as Adova is concerned, it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator which is given to avoid estrogen induced side effects."

Please advice.",1.1 is still within normal range for PSA.2. Increase of PSA is due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and not due to cancer.3. You can be reassured that your PSA level indicates nothing serious.4. Continue with your TRT as well as other medications.5. Regular follow up of PSA levels is advised. Hope it helps.
893,"Hello doctor,My A1c is 5.4 and my fasting glucose is 107 and I was taking 800 mg of Seroquel which is a medication for paranoid schizophrenia and is known for causing diabetes and high blood sugar and five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, one day my sugar went over 200 and the next day five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, my sugar went up to 495. So, I stopped the Seroquel. According to my A1c, I am a nondiabetic, according to my fasting glucose, I am a pre-diabetic, and according to those two high blood sugar readings, I am a serious diabetic. Those are three different diagnoses. But those two high readings could have just been because of the Seroquel because I have never had high readings like that other than when I was taking the Seroquel and I was taking a high dose. A lot of people only take 100 to 200 mg, but I was taking 800 mg. So, do you think I am a diabetic or do you think it was just the Seroquel that caused the two high readings?"," The seroquel has not been associated with diabetes. It may cause weight gain and abnormal lipid profile. But there are no reports of diabetes due to seroquel. Diabetes can occur in response to stress, emotional disturbance, infection etc. It doesn't mean that all the symptoms are due to seroquel. You should get your self investigated thoroughly and see if there is any underlying cause for these symptoms."

Is there any problem for the baby because I am on 38 weeks 2 days now, but base on my ultrasound the baby is 36 weeks.",36 weeks is normal. The fetus size can vary from one person to another. This is why doctors use charts to calculate the expected date of delivery. You may get a few days difference in your due date calculation and actual delivery date. So don't worry about it. As long as the baby is growing well and not showing signs of distress or low birth weight then there should not be anything to worry about. Hope this helps

Recently have had symptoms come back and had my B12 checked and it was low, 265, but in the recommended range, however, I do take a supplement with B12 in it which would have pushed my level up a bit. My symptoms are fatigue, pins, and needles in hands and feet, slow cognition. Should I be receiving injections again?"," Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  You can take oral vitamin B 12 tablets for your symptoms.  But if you want to get rid of this problem permanently then you should go for an injection of vitamin B 12, as it will give you more benefit than oral medication.  But you should consult your physician before taking any treatment.  Wishing you good health.  Best regards."

After I hit puberty, I do not think my parents noticed anything, but people have said I sound like Kermit the frog or that I need to stop mumbling. The problem I have is that I have to try quite hard to speak in a normal tone, and I am extremely self-conscious about the way I sound. I breathed through my mouth my entire life until I had a septoplasty three years back. Now I can breathe through one nostril, which I guess is 60 % open, while the other one is always 100 % blocked.

897,"Hello doctor,My daughter is 6 years old. About 10 to 11 months back we saw a very very small dark black colored dot on her side of the tongue. But now there are 4 to 5 similar sized dot around her tongue on both sides. The size has not grown. But it is just that new location has emerged. Lately she is continuously touching her tongue and her tip of tongue appears red. She says she feels like there is a hair on her tongue and there is some sensation on her tongue.

898,"Hello doctor,I am a 34 year old male. I had anxiety issues since childhood. I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own. I use to get those episodes every few months when I had stress but since I got the fear it might never go away I get it almost daily now. I do not know what to do. Can anxiety cause polyuria like this clear urine when I am stressed?",1) Anxiety can be associated with polyuria. Polyuria is excessive urination more than 2 liters per day. So if your urine volume is less than 2 liters per day then there is no need to worry about polyuria. You should see a psychiatrist as soon as possible.2) You may be having Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This is a type of anxiety disorder. OCD patients keep on repeating certain thoughts and behaviors which they think will relieve their anxiety. But these thoughts and behavior are actually making the situation worse. So OCD patients need to learn how to control their thoughts and behaviors. A good psychologist can help you in this regard.

900,"Hello doctor,My 76-year-old father had urinary infection last month with a high number of pus cells. The infection started with fever and shivering and slight pain with urination. The doctor prescribed Oflox 200 mg twice a day. After that, he was also prescribed ultrasound scanning. In the scanning, it showed that his prostate was minimally enlarged.After antibiotic treatment and based on the ultrasound report, the doctor prescribed Urimax 0.4 mg once per day. The urine culture was also normal. After starting the treatment, the flow of urine is normal now and sometimes little out of control and early. Why is he passing urine a little early even before reaching the toilet?","1) Please note that a urinalysis and routine blood tests will not be able to pinpoint the cause for your fathers symptoms. It could be an infection or enlargement of the prostate gland which can lead to urinary problems.2) The urethral opening is just below the bladder neck where there is a narrow neck region, so if there is any obstruction here then the urine may spill over into the vagina.3) You need to consult a Urologist who would examine him physically and get some basic investigations done like a Cystoscopy."

Please get a full physical examination done by a good physician to rule out any organic cause of your symptoms like diabetes mellitus or inflammation.2. Premature ejaculation is a psychological issue which is related to anxiety about performance. You need to practice relaxation exercises and be confident that you will perform well.

I have a 2-cm kidney stone and they put a stent in.I do not want to have surgery. I am scared that the use of natural remedies can hurt the stent or move the stone to block where I go to pee. I had a CAT scan at urgent care.Will they use local anesthesia for this instead of general or something else? Can the kidney stones come out from behind? I have diabetes. Can lemons and olive oil help treat this? Currently, I am on Metformin, Aspirin, Simvastatin, and Lisinopril.",1. You should be very careful with any natural remedy as they can cause serious complications if used without proper guidance.2. I would recommend using only medications prescribed by your urologist.3.

903,"Hi doctor,I am in a little trouble. Summer has started where I live, and I am addicted to playing cricket, whatever the weather or climate be. From last two weeks, I have noticed that my face color has become darker due to the sun. So, I am a little confused about which sunblock cream to use. I need your suggestion on which cream to use. I do not understand the concept of SPF 25, 30, 50 and 60.","1) SPF stands for sun protection factor. It is a measure of how long you can stay out in the sun before getting burned without wearing sunscreen. 2) A sunscreen with an SPF of 15 will protect you from the sun's rays for about 15 times longer than if you weren't wearing it. This means that if you would normally burn after 10 minutes in the sun, then you would be protected for 150 minutes (or almost three hours). 3) The higher the number, the better. SPF 60 is much more effective than SPF 30. 4) To get maximum benefit, apply the sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out into the sun, and reapply every 2-3 hours."

I went back to look through all my labs from my teenage years from a rheumatologist. I saw and I never had high protein. Also, my platelets were usually normal so I think the elevated thing is more recent? But it has gone down from 423 three years ago.I show no active signs and lupus and never truly did.

I have read about leukemia and other blood cancers. I was fasting for more than 12 hours and drank no water (I hardly ever do). All other labs are normal in the metabolic panel and CBC with auto diff.","1. The protein level of 8.9 is slightly higher than normal. It may be due to increased muscle mass or liver disease. It should be repeated after a few weeks to see if it increases further. 2. Increased Beta-2 GPS is not an indication for aspirin per se. However, since you are young and healthy, you could continue taking it as a prophylaxis against heart attack.3. Leukemia is unlikely because your other parameters are within normal limits."

There are heterosexual people with same problems.2) Homosexuals do have their own unique set of issues due to social stigma and biased attitude prevalent in society but this does not mean that they will be more likely than others to commit suicide or suffer from mental disorders.3) Also, homosexuals are no lesser human beings than anyone else and they deserve equal respect and love like everyone else.4) You should not worry about your cousins child. They are doing nothing wrong by being homosexuals."
925,"Hi doctor,My mom is 83 years old. She had a bad fall 1.5 years ago and suffered with a head injury with little internal bleeding and a broken arm. While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that your mother is suffering from Dementia and this is causing her confusion, forgetfulness, poor balance etc. It might be better if you consult a Neurologist who can examine her and do necessary tests like MRI brain scan to rule out any neurological condition.

Unless his bilirubin levels come down and his enzymes and INR levels become normal, he will need intensive care support.2) The only way to improve or reverse liver damage in such cases is by liver transplantation.3) However, that can be done only in centers where there is adequate expertise in performing liver transplants and they are equipped with necessary facilities.4) You do need to consult a hepatologist who can guide you further about the possibility of getting him treated in India as well as abroad if need be."

But you must do the blood tests for complete hormone profile and ultrasound to rule out any complications.2. The abortion pills should be used under medical supervision.3. The abortion pills will lead to incomplete abortion in most cases. Incomplete abortions may require surgical intervention and hence you must consult your gynecologist before taking the pills.

My doctor tells me it is not stabilized, but may become that way sometime in the future, but now needs frequent treatments. What should I do? Is there any stretching exercise that will free up the joint? Any other advice?","1. You need to see if the instability of the sacroiliac joint is causing your symptoms.

I experience this every year, as in yearly so I assumed it is normal.

I have read a lot about the benefits of topical retinoid, vitamin E and C serum.

937,"Hello doctor,I am 47 today. I went to my primary doctor three years ago with low libido and poor quality erections. Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated. Thanks."," Hi, Thanks for writing in. Testosterone resistance is a real entity and many patients who present to me with such complaints. I would suggest you to go ahead with the testosterone replacement therapy and see how it works. You need to take tablets of testosterone for about 3 months before deciding whether to continue or not. So wait and watch and then decide. As far as your current problems are concerned, if you are not having any other symptoms, you can continue with the medication you are currently using and exercise regularly."

As my daughter is licking her fingers, my mom wants to keep castor oil or neem oil, is it safe to keep it on her finger?","1) It is not recommended to use Urai Marudhu for babies as it contains high levels of lead and other heavy metals which can be harmful to your child.2) Castor oil/neem oil cannot be kept on the finger for long periods of time because it will cause irritation, redness, blisters etc. You should apply only small amounts at any given time.3) The best way to ensure that your child does not get exposed to these substances in the first place would be to avoid using them altogether.

This treatment kind fits me because I have lessened anxiety levels for sure. It is my first week on Venlafaxine XR. And the second week on Lamictal. In a few days we will increase Lamictal to 100 mg and after two weeks to 200 mg. I also take Tranxene 10 mg if needed, as well as Olanzapine 10 mg. How come I responded to Venlafaxine XR so fast, when I did not respond to SSRI? I lack energy and motivation, should I increase Venlafaxine XR to 150? If so, will it have more effects on my anxiety and depressive episode?",1) Venlafaxine XR has not been studied in comparison to other antidepressants in clinical trials.2) Your response to venlafaxine XR could be due to your personal genetic makeup which may predispose you to its action or due to some other factors like dietary habits etc.3) You need to try out different types of medicines before deciding upon the one that suits you best.4) The dosage of lamotrigine can be increased gradually over a period of time depending on the dose-response relationship.5) There is no scientific evidence to support the use of higher doses of venlafaxine XR than what is prescribed by your doctor.

940,"Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose. The amount of rest I have taken and all those manipulations have gone through have only done badly rather than doing any good. I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months.

As you mentioned, you have undergone treatment for disc prolapse at L4/5 and L5/S1 levels. You have been prescribed bed rest for 9 months. But even after that, you have not recovered completely. This suggests that you may need some additional treatment like physical therapy. You said that you had pain in tailbone area. This is suggestive of nerve compression at sacral level.

954,"Hi doctor,I am a 30-year-old woman. I am having OCD since I was 12 years old. I have a strong fear of an event that happened a couple of years ago when a psychiatrist told me that I have a borderline disorder and have no fantasy. I was trying to ask her for years to say me the opposite as a compulsion. She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion. My mother was encouraging me to do these kinds of compulsions as she thought it is going to get worse. It was a bad thing as she was validating my fears in this way. I just realized these things now so I started to confront my fears about what the psychiatrist said to me. But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?"," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It seems that you are suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) which is characterized by recurrent thoughts, ideas or impulses which are intrusive and unwanted. You need to consult a psychiatrist for proper treatment. You can take fluoxetine and paroxetine both are effective in OCD. In addition, you may also require cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Hope this helps. Take care."
955,"Hi doctor,I am a 34 year old female. I have been having terrible anxiety the past month. I wake up feeling very uneasy and nervous. Almost shaky. I also feel like I literally cannot breathe. I have to take deep breaths constantly. I went to an urgent care and they tested for a blood clot in the lungs, but I was cleared. My doctor put me on Lexapro two months ago and I stopped taking it. But then the anxiety got so bad that I started again on it two weeks ago. My fear is that there is something wrong with my heart. I have had this before and chest pain. So, I have been to two different cardiologists. We did stress tests and echoes. I am afraid these doctors are blowing me off because I am active. Please advise.","1) It appears from your history that you have a lot of anxiety which can be due to hyperventilation.2) You need to see a psychiatrist who will prescribe you medication for anxiety and depression.3) If you are not comfortable with medicine, you may try some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or yoga.4) Avoid alcohol and smoking if you have any habit.5) Regular exercise will help reduce anxiety.

I am so lazy and feel like I do not want to live. I am weak and I lack concentration. I do not feel like going out of my house. Suggest treatment for the same."," Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

957,"Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with a left branch bundle block a few years back. I have been under the care of a cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine since then. I have done stress echos yearly or every two years since and have been told my heart is otherwise fine. I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low. I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear. I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed."," Hi, I read your question carefully and understand your concern. The first thing I should mention is that your doctor is right about the need for nuclear stress test. The reason is that it can detect better any abnormality in the heart function which may be missed in the routine echo. On the other hand, the regular echo is still needed as a screening tool to exclude possible heart valve problems. As far as the family history is concerned, it does increase the risk of coronary artery disease. You should try to control your cholesterol levels and blood pressure as much as possible. In addition, I recommend having an annual physical check up including a resting ECG and lipid profile. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Kind regards,"
958,"Hi doctor,I had a c-section with my first pregnancy 19 years ago. I have fallen in love with a wonderful man who does not have kids. I and my fiance have been discussing and are planning to have a baby. I am concerned if I am able to have a VBAC delivery with my second pregnancy since my first pregnancy resulted in an emergency C-section. Also, I am 48. What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?"," Thank you for posting your query at Chat Doctor. I read carefully through your question and understand your concern. Pregnancy after cesarean section is safe and possible. However, there is a risk of uterine rupture which can be prevented by using a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) protocol. This includes cervical ripening with prostaglandin gel, monitoring of contractions and fetal heart rate and close observation of the uterus during labor. The risk of uterine rupture is about 2% or less. It is important that you find a doctor experienced in VBAC delivery. You should also consider having a repeat cesarean delivery if you develop problems during labor such as high blood pressure or fever. Age alone does not increase the risk of complications during pregnancy. At age 48, you will probably need more frequent ultrasounds and tests because of the advanced maternal"

960,"Hello doctor,My wife has lung cancer PD-L1. I need your advice regarding the continuation of this therapy. Docetaxel and Nintedanib are suggested. I think it is too heavy. I would prefer immunotherapy, if possible."," In the treatment of lung cancer, immunotherapy is not yet approved by FDA for being used as a first line treatment. The only available immunotherapies for lung cancer are nivolumab and pembrolizumab which are both approved by FDA. They are used in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors). These treatments may also be given to people whose cancer has worsened after surgery or radiation therapy. These medicines are usually used in combination with another type of medicine called an antiangiogenic (such as cediranib). There is very limited evidence that any of these treatments will help slow down the spread of the disease."

962,"Hi doctor,I have had a terrible cough for weeks due to the flu. I decided to try Delsym 12 hour cough. It helped immensely, but the second day when I had it, I noticed a bit of restlessness and light sensitivity. I waited to take another dose and when I did take another dose, I took half of the recommended dose for adults. That was at 10 pm last night. Now, at almost 2 pm the next day and I am experiencing odd side effects. Sweaty palms, a bit of confusion, loss of attention, and light sensitivity. It feels like my eyes are dilated, but does not appear they are. Every day I take 20 mg of Vyvanse and 300 mg of Wellbutrin.","1) As per your query this is a combination of dextromethorphan HBr and guaifenesin. Dextromethorphan HBr is a cough suppressant that affects certain natural substances in the body which causes cough reflex. Guaiphenesin is a cough expectorant. This means that these medicines may help reduce how much you cough by causing less secretions. But this also means that these medicines won't help loosen phlegm or mucus so easily as many other medications would.2) The symptoms of sweating palms, blurred vision, confusion etc. can be due to over dosage of Chat Doctor. 3) You should consult your Physician for further treatment.

I am not married or pregnant.Recently, I have been having a problem of breast leakage and during intercourse, my boyfriend has also shared the same concern.It is embarrassing & alarming at the same time. What could be the reason?",1- I don't know why you are thinking that it is a serious problem. The most common cause for this type of symptoms is hormonal imbalance. The best way to get rid of these problems is to start birth control pills. It will regulate your menstruation and hormones. If you have any other health issue then you should consult with your gynecologist and he/she can help you in identifying the cause and treat you accordingly.

The use of Stem Cell Creams may not cause any adverse effect.2. It is better to take the medications prescribed by your dermatologist as and when required.3.

967,"Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.",1. The idea of removing the eye because of pain is not a good option. It is better to try other options first.2. Contact lenses are very helpful in controlling pain associated with bullous keratopathy.3. The cornea becomes thickened and fibrotic due to the disease process. This makes the contact lenses less effective at controlling pain.4. There are other types of contact lenses available that might not cause irritation like the ones he currently uses.5. There also are medicated lubricating eye drops that may help reduce the discomfort.6. The eye pressure should be monitored regularly.7. The best way to treat this is to see his ophthalmologist and discuss the different options that are available. Hope this helps.
968,"Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure. I am taking homeopathy for the past 25 days. It worked for the first 20 days, but for the past five days, my pain has increased significantly. Is it homeopathy aggravation or something else?",1) If you have taken homeopathic treatment for about 25 days and your symptoms improved for about 20 days then you should not worry about the fact that your symptoms are worsening now as this could be due to aggravation of the symptoms which is common in case of homeopathic medicines. 2) You can continue with the same medicine for another 15-20 days more and if symptoms still don't improve then you need to consult a physician or surgeon who would examine you and prescribe appropriate treatment.

Can you please guide me regarding further management?","1st thing is to find out if it is significant proteinuria or microalbuminuria. You can check that by doing an early morning sample of urine which will show any albumin present in the urine. If there is no proteinuria then we need to rule out other causes like heart failure, liver disease, etc. As you are taking blood pressure medications, get your kidney function tests done as well. You may also need to get your urine culture tested. Avoid fatty foods and take healthy diet."

When I had the blood work done, I was crying for an hour due to unrelated massive stress factors. I have severe anxiety and I am going through a rough time, I am hardly ever at ease. I am mentioning this because I read stress can be a factor.I am worried because my levels are elevated and I show no signs of infection apart from the eye (which still has a little pus). I do not go out due to COVID-19 at all. Food is delivered and handled in a very safe way, packages are disinfected and I have no contact with anyone. I am puzzled as to where an infection could come from. My doctor thinks it is a bacterial infection and has put me on antibiotics. I am very worried about cancer. Should I be?"," Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As your complete blood count report shows high white cell count, it may indicate some kind of infection.

I gave warm water and honey, and it has subsided a lot.Sometimes her voice sounds normal, and when she screams or cries, I can still feel her voice is a little hoarse.

On the doctor's advice, she took some medicines and bleeding occurred. She was known hypothyroid. So, she was taking Thyroxin 50 or 75 to keep the TSH near about 2.5 Uiu/ml. Her Hb % and sugar are within the normal range.Again, she tried to conceive since three months ago along with Aspirin and folic acid. She missed her period last month. Her beta hCG was 9.20 mIu/ mL. It was repeated after two days. It came down to 1 Miu/ml suggestive of \chemical pregnancy\. This time, after a few days, a spontaneous jelly-like bleeding occurred for two days. I would like to add that her husband requires to take Penegra 50 mg tab before a performance. Our daughter is immunized with triple antigen, polio, MMR, chickenpox and hepatitis B vaccine in childhood. The transvaginal scan (done at a later phase of the first conception) showed normal anatomical and physiological pattern of the ovary and uterus to me at least (report attached).Two consecutive miscarriages brought great disappointment to all. Presently, the doctor told her to take Aspirin 150 mg, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 combination tablet and to try for pregnancy again. I want your valuable opinion regarding subsequent management or the right line of treatment and suggestions or tests (if any) to get a successful pregnancy and healthy baby."," Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your daughter has gone through two chemical pregnancies, which means that there were no fetal heart beats detected in the ultrasonography scans. This can happen due to many reasons such as, unhealthy eggs, abnormal sperm, or problems with the embryo. I would advise her to undergo blood test for ovarian reserve and AMH level to determine if she has sufficient number of eggs left. Also, do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels. In case all these come out to be normal then I would suggest her to go ahead with IVF procedure. Hope this helps."

991,"Hello doctor,I have had a lower back pain for the last couple of years. It all started after I lifted a stone at a cricket ground. A little amount of physiotherapy helped after the doctor\s advice. I have consulted three doctors in two years and a doctor advised MRI this week. My doctor is out until next week and I am very anxious to understand the MRI report. Kindly help me understand the report.","1) The MRI will show if there is any disc herniation or spinal canal stenosis. This is the most common cause of low back pain2) If there is no significant findings then it may be due to muscle strain3) In such case, your doctor should be able to give you some exercises which can help you4) If you have severe symptoms then an epidural steroid injection may be helpful5) However, it is important that you see a doctor as soon as possible so that we can rule out other causes of back pain"

I cannot feel any lumps on palpation. Should I get additional examination?"," Hi, It seems that you have a normal testis and there is no need to worry.

993,"Hello doctor,I fell off the bike. I took X-rays and the doctor is telling me that both elbows are broken. As a non-professional, I cannot see if it is really broken. I do not have any pain if I am not stretching the elbow too much. Are both elbows really broken? And if yes, do I have to wear the cast for 2 to 3 weeks?","1) If the x-ray confirms fracture, then yes, it has to be in plaster for at least two to three weeks. 2) Non-professionals can only judge the appearance of the bones but not their integrity. In other words, they can only tell whether a bone looks broken or not. Only an expert can tell whether there is a fracture or not. So, if the X-ray shows a fracture, you will need to wear a cast for at least two to three weeks. Hope this helps!"
994,"Hello doctor,I had a question about the ketone diet. I honestly do not understand the benefits of a ketone diet, what are they? Is a ketone diet good for those who are diabetic?"," Hi, thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. Ketosis is a metabolic state where body uses fat as its main source of energy instead of carbohydrates. In this condition ketones are produced in liver which is excreted in urine. This happens when there is no glucose available in blood and body has to burn fats for energy. It is beneficial in some diseases like epilepsy and cancer. But as far as diabetics are concerned it is not recommended because it may worsen their control over blood sugar level."

998,"Hi doctor,My wife is indifferent to child health issues. She controls the child with threatening words. The child cannot cry or weep even with an extreme reprimand by her. She makes the child sleep under extreme pressure. Sometimes, the child wets the bed. She then becomes furious with him. All this has led him to be a withdrawn child and always compromising. Please suggest me."," Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your problem. You have not mentioned whether your child is male or female. But from the symptoms it seems that he is of about 3 years age. It seems that his mother is over protective and she is afraid that if he will cry or make any sort of sound, then people around will get angry at him. This type of behavior may lead the child to develop some kind of fear psychosis in future which can cause anxiety disorder and depression. He needs proper counseling and counseling sessions for both parents. I hope this helps you. Thank you."
999,"Hi doctor, I have been taking Effexor XR 300 mg for depression. It has been working really well. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me Strattera for ADHD. I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination? I know my psychiatrist knows what he is doing, but I wanted to get a second opinion from others.",1) You should not take both of them together as they are similar in action.2) If your symptoms are improving with effexor then why would you want to change it?3) If you are having any problem with effexor then you should discuss it with your psychiatrist.4) If you are still unsure then try to change one at a time and if that doesn't help then you can try the other. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
